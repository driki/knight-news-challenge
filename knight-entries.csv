Mobile Markers: Enhancing the Transparency of Calling Records Analysis To Support Policy Decision Making  ,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25602838836/mobile-markers-enhancing-the-transparency-of-calling,150000,Enhance transparency around the use of cellphone calling records to model social behaviors useful for institutions working for public good.,"Calling records’ analysis has been criticized for lack of transparency. We propose to build transparency-enhancing, privacy-preserving tools to help cellphone customers understand how their records are used and their potential impact on policy development. We expect that such transparency will encourage customers to donate their records for social good. ",We are the first telecommunications company to propose privacy-preserving tools that promote transparency in the analysis of calling records with the aim of helping institutions that work for social good.,"We have demonstrated that the calling records collected by telecommunications companies provide behavioral fingerprints like mobility or communication patterns that give a better understanding of how citizens across different socioeconomic levels interact with their environments. This information can aid decision makers in public and private institutions assess critical policy changes in areas like urban planning or global health. We believe that by engaging with cell phone customers and explaining in a transparent way the use of their anonymized records and its positive impact on policy decisions, we will be able to share both data and results with the community.","We are a team of researchers from Telefonica Research with a background in machine learning, security and big data. Our members hold academic degrees from prestigious institutions including Columbia University and UCLA. We have a large experience in the analysis of calling records collected by telecommunication companies and its application to policy issues in areas like urban planning, crisis management or global health. We also collaborate with United Nations Global Pulse and Telefonica Foundation to identify critical policy issues where anonymized calling records can provide complementary behavioral information.","We have built the analytical tools that use calling records to compute social behaviors relevant for policy decisions. Additionally, we have built policy tools in the areas of urban planning and global health that use calling records to help on decision making (see Figures). Both analytical and policy  tools will be useful to allow cellphone customers explore how their data is used and its potential applications in policy issues. We believe that this information will add transparency to the analysis and will encourage customers to share their anonymized data by selecting across different levels of privacy-enhanced calling records sharing. http://www.vanessafriasmartinez.org/images/fd04a1d0e0b693a0a912f99a644929bb_kabz.jpg",To fund software developers to code open-source tools that will allow customers to understand their data and decide how much they want to share.

Moreover, WNYC regularly works with Patchwork Nation, and has a built-in use for the project in its award-winning newsroom.  WNYC also has the existing technical infrastructure and experience it needs to execute new data maps and share its methodology and framework with peers, colleagues, and other interested parties. ","  [50 words] News Challenge funds would be used to pilot Patchwork WNYC in New York City, including the collection of the raw data from the Census and other sources; the analysis of that data and its categorization into community types; development of the front-end interface and data maps; and reporting on news stories.  ","The most expensive aspects of the project are the front end data analysis, sorting/categorization, and web development/interface.  In New York, WNYC and Patchwork Nation will absorb the costs of updating the community groupings every two years with information from census surveys, elections, and economic measures."
The Detail: Data (Northern Ireland),http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25603135332/the-detail-data-northern-ireland,340000,"We would be the data journalism centre of excellence for Northern Ireland, sharing our data content with other media outlets. .","We will build on our public interest data journalism to make complicated information accessible and meaningful in a post-conflict society, adjusting to accountable governance. This will create a strong interactive reference catalogue of important data. We will also provide versions of our stories for use in local news outlets.","The Detail is the only media outlet providing expert data journalism focused on Northern Ireland. Our online presence allows us to provide interactive data visualisation, in-depth analysis and context.","We already have a strong reputation for our investigations and know there is a need for data journalism expertise in Northern Ireland. Many other media outlets do not have the time or skills to handle large volumes of data and are keen to publish our pieces. Like ProPublica, we provide versions of our stories and graphics for national and local media and would like to expand this service with a wider range of data stories. The relatively new government in Northern Ireland needs to be subject to rigorous scrutiny and this is one way of ensuring this is done.","Our senior reporter Kathryn Torney is currently working on our data stories. Kathryn received training in data journalism at the Centre for Investigative Journalism at London’s City University last October. She was shortlisted and received an honorary mention in the first international Data Journalism Awards this year.

We would expand our team of data reporters and pay for programming and graphic design input. We would also offer data journalism training sessions to other Northern Ireland reporters.,We would look at other funding streams and would also consider advertising revenue and charging for our content. Being an established and respected data centre as a result of the Knight Foundation funding would greatly help with all of these possible future options.
Mobile Markers: Enhancing the Transparency of Calling Records Analysis To Support Policy Decision Making  ,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25602838836/mobile-markers-enhancing-the-transparency-of-calling,150000,Enhance transparency around the use of cellphone calling records to model social behaviors useful for institutions working for public good.,"Calling records’ analysis has been criticized for lack of transparency. We propose to build transparency-enhancing, privacy-preserving tools to help cellphone customers understand how their records are used and their potential impact on policy development. We expect that such transparency will encourage customers to donate their records for social good. ",We are the first telecommunications company to propose privacy-preserving tools that promote transparency in the analysis of calling records with the aim of helping institutions that work for social good.,"We have demonstrated that the calling records collected by telecommunications companies provide behavioral fingerprints like mobility or communication patterns that give a better understanding of how citizens across different socioeconomic levels interact with their environments. This information can aid decision makers in public and private institutions assess critical policy changes in areas like urban planning or global health. We believe that by engaging with cell phone customers and explaining in a transparent way the use of their anonymized records and its positive impact on policy decisions, we will be able to share both data and results with the community.","We are a team of researchers from Telefonica Research with a background in machine learning, security and big data. Our members hold academic degrees from prestigious institutions including Columbia University and UCLA. We have a large experience in the analysis of calling records collected by telecommunication companies and its application to policy issues in areas like urban planning, crisis management or global health. We also collaborate with United Nations Global Pulse and Telefonica Foundation to identify critical policy issues where anonymized calling records can provide complementary behavioral information.","We have built the analytical tools that use calling records to compute social behaviors relevant for policy decisions. Additionally, we have built policy tools in the areas of urban planning and global health that use calling records to help on decision making (see Figures). Both analytical and policy  tools will be useful to allow cellphone customers explore how their data is used and its potential applications in policy issues. We believe that this information will add transparency to the analysis and will encourage customers to share their anonymized data by selecting across different levels of privacy-enhanced calling records sharing. http://www.vanessafriasmartinez.org/images/fd04a1d0e0b693a0a912f99a644929bb_kabz.jpg",To fund software developers to code open-source tools that will allow customers to understand their data and decide how much they want to share. To run workshops at public and private institutions to show the power of the calling records and to engage them as beneficiary partners.,"We believe that organizations like the GSMA or telecommunication companies worldwide will be eager to support this project once we have shown that customers engage with the idea. In fact, these transparency-enhancing, privacy-preserving tools will improve the public image of the companies while contributing to the societies they benefit from."

The tool takes cues from online social networks and tries to integrate with them to reach a larger local audience.,"inTeractive Somerville, hand designed, connects users through media. The project bridges the digital divide by bringing the tool to users through workshops and invites disenfranchised citizens to plan their community.","With active participation from Somerville’s diverse constituency in SCC’s grassroots planning, the community can envision what it wants, help direct sustainable changes in neighborhoods, and connect community priorities to projects on the ground. Specifically, it aims to involve residents who may not typically participate in the traditional planning process, and does so by taking the tool to groups through workshops to spawn new projects and input from participants. This would encourage participants to gain technology, planning, and design skills, and to connect these skills with public policy and planning.

These groups reflect the target constituency we hope to include, i.e. low and moderate income residents representing Somerville’s broad cultural/racial diversity. SCC will continue to grow its list of partners.","A working prototype is available online, where users (currently about 100 local registered users) can submit and geolocate ideas, photos, videos or data. The prototype enables basic community interactions (profiles, commenting, rating), provides enough functionality to gather input to a planning process and visualizes contributed information through map interfaces. There are a few similar online tools available, such as IdeaScale, MindMixer or Neighborland, with limited free plans and premium plans for some customization around design and integration in existing web sites. None of them satisfied the requirements for the intended degree of customization, mapping and geo-locating community input for the existing prototype.","These funds would assist with a technical update that includes: improved modularity, design and usability, archive functionalities, educational features and an outreach toolkit.

Community Health Analytics: Making Community Health Data Useful,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25580291864/community-health-analytics-making-community-health,700000,Improve a billion lives by enabling governments and organizations to better serve people living in extreme poverty through smarter use of community health data.,"Community health workers—villagers trained to provide essential health services in their communities—are often the first line of care for the billion people worldwide who live on less than a dollar a day. Soon, these health workers will ubiquitously use mobile devices to report on their activities, creating huge amounts of real-time data on health events such as births, illnesses, and hospitalizations. We will create practical tools for understanding and acting upon these data.","Health systems rarely take full advantage of community health data, typically only calculating aggregate statistics for official reports. Metrics are often unclearly defined; data quality is suspect; and analysis is not oriented for action.","Across diverse sectors, data analytics has revolutionized how businesses operate. Health care, however, has lagged behind, due in part to widespread reliance on paper-based information systems. But this is changing. Surprisingly, adoption of electronic health technologies has been fastest in the very settings that lack electricity. Equipped with mobile phones, community health workers in these settings are able to instantaneously and seamlessly report health data to cloud-based servers, forming a robust, distributed “peripheral nervous system.” But in this new data-rich environment, the “brain”—the central system for processing and analyzing information—is missing. Creating this brain will unlock massive potential for understanding community health dynamics and responding appropriately with data-driven interventions.","This project is a partnership between three organizations: Partners In Health (PIH) is a nonprofit organization that works with the governments of 12 countries to support 8,000 community health workers in program contexts ranging from single diseases (HIV, diabetes) to comprehensive primary care. Dimagi is a technology company whose market-leading, open-source mobile health platform, CommCare, is being used by 3,000 community health workers in 15 countries, with a user base expected to grow to 25,000 in three years. Researchers at Harvard Business School (HBS) partner with governments in developing countries to develop analytic tools and implement randomized experiments to understand and improve the performance of community health workers.","Across key dimensions of data analytics, the project partners are at the vanguard of making community health data more useful. This project will enable the partners to come together formally to build an integrated community health analytics system. Metrics: PIH and Dimagi lead the Maternal Concept Lab, a consortium that is creating a concept dictionary of core terminology, indicators, and standards for community-based maternal health programs. Data Quality: PIH and HBS are developing tools to improve the quality of data collected by community health workers, using methodologies such as Lot Quality Assurance Sampling and digit-based statistical tests. Analytics: Dimagi and HBS are developing data-processing algorithms that allow programs to rapidly analyze community health data, as well as analytic models for explaining the performance of community health workers based on individual and community characteristics.","In at least three countries in Africa and South Asia, we will create and deploy a unified, technology-agnostic framework and toolkit for community health analytics. This system will include: interoperable indicators and standards; tools and methodologies for data quality assessment; and “dashboard” and “analysis” software applications that make sense of community health data with techniques such as visualization, cluster analysis, and regression. Key project stages will include design, development, piloting, deployment, and evaluation. ",This project is catalytic; its true impact will emerge as governments and organizations adopt our open-source tools in large-scale community health programs that are independently funded. Further development will be carried out by a development community that will emerge organically as more organizations adopt the system.

HCRL staff provides a wealth of expertise in identifying needs and converting data to compelling visual formats, while United Way 2-1-1 offers connections to community agencies through its extensive history of community empowerment. Because 2-1-1 data are from the community and the dashboard makes that data available, it was important that the partners be members of the community. ","Over the last six years, Washington University and partners have invested $2.6 million into the 2-1-1 project. Throughout this time, advancements have been made in both data management and information design, and an assessment of 2-1-1-stakeholder input was completed. Moving forward, the project consists of three phases: Computer programming, User interface design, and Implementation, and work has started in each. Initial programming has begun, and graphic depictions or prototypes for the Dashboard have been developed. Washington University, in conjunction with United Way 2-1-1, also recently met with potential user groups to conduct audience research and raise awareness of the project. ","The overall Dashboard budget of $600,000 has been divided to correspond with previously mentioned phases of the project. The News Challenge funds would support core tasks from the first two phases: Computer programming and User interface design. Additional resources, including in-kind, would be used to support the remainder of the costs.","While major investments will be needed to design and program this one-of-a-kind dashboard, once built, it will be largely self-sustaining.

Increasingly, volunteers offer audio streams over the Internet. This is data, but unstructured. I want to provide a method for people to convert that into meaningful information that shows what emergency services are doing in real time and in the past.","My project would build on the work of radioreference.com. I would make it simpler to monitor multiple feeds, find out what happened earlier and to tag and share scanner audio.","There already exists a community of people who listen to scanner feeds religiously. They may be off-duty emergency services personnel, interested citizens or detached journalists. This would hand them a better experience and, in the process, enlist them in a process of converting scanner feeds into structured and meaningful data. They will in turn profit because they can see, say, the top ten incidents from the last 24 hours without having to listen the whole time or the current set of incidents on a live-updating map.

I’ve built projects of this scope for fun, including commontreasure.com. Last year, I worked at the Sunlight Foundation as a reporting fellow.","I’ve looked into the technology necessary. The time-shifting element requires me to record and rebroadcast a feed, which I tested successfully with the open source StreamRipper project. I’ve also tested Icecast for just broadcasting. I want to use HTML5 streaming audio, which I’ve researched, and the canvas element for real-time waveforms, which I’ve used before for graphing. If the audio element proves too immature, I’ll revert to a hidden Flash audio player, which I have built before. There still remain challenges, particularly in the time-shifting component, but they’re surmountable.","The software will all be open source, and therefore free. The funds would pay for a year of hosting on RackSpace’s cloud service or similar ($1,500); if permissible, some small amount would compensate my time on the project ($1,000; would forgo this if needed); and marketing through targeted channels ($1,000).","I hope to have a business model centered around charging reasonable amounts for premium services.

The staff of the office will lead, coordinate, and maintain the project and conduct asset mapping, and the office leadership will hire experts to create a user-friendly and intuitive design.","The University of Miami’s Office of Civic and Community Engagement has been meeting and building relationships with many local community groups and organizations. We consistently work to foster stronger connections with the South Florida community. We also work to bring together policy experts, not-for-profits, scientists, grassroots activists, urban planners, government agencies, community members, faculty, and students to identify needs, develop strategies for solutions, and help translate local activism into effective public policy. We have worked since the office’s inception to act as the kind of data clearinghouse Mapping Miami will become. ","The funds will be used to hire a project manager to lead and conduct asset mapping, and to cover the cost of site development and implementation of the project.",Working with design professionals to ensure a sustainable site and investing local stakeholders in the project will help to ensure that the information Mapping Miami makes available is constantly updated and accurate.
"Visualizing Health Disparities in Oakland, California",http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25579254960/visualizing-health-disparities-in-oakland-california,3000,"I propose an interactive map layering data concerning health disparities in Oakland, allowing users to explore various sets of information.","The interactive map will let users sort and layer information, encouraging exploration of data sets and relationships. Variables like rates of asthma, obesity and heart disease are paired with environmental factors—presence of grocery stores, income, etc. The visual, interactive presentation will engage users, facilitating discovery of relationships among data.",There are snapshots of health in Oakland using static maps. My interactive map will show conditions over time for public health in Oakland and be revised with up-to-date information periodically.,"Interactive features about local community health can facilitate change. This map will make data accessible and visual, providing a picture of environmental factors in Oakland and how they influence public health. Text, video and graphics provide context, creating a complete interactive news package. Visual representation of data lets users see change and draw conclusions about relationships between environmental factors and public health. Users will also see which public health interventions are effective over the years. The map can be a tool for groups doing advocacy work concerning air quality, healthy food, crime and other factors that affect the health of Oakland residents.","I will work on the map and accompanying video, text, and graphics as my Master’s project at Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism. I will have the support and guidance of the school’s multimedia professors, who have extensive knowledge of coding, design and data visualization. There could not be a better team to support the creation of this map. I plan on integrating the project with OaklandNorth.net, a hyper-local news site run by students. I will collaborate with the students assigned to Oakland next year, as I believe collaborative efforts yield the best results.","In April I wrote an article about air pollution in West Oakland and high rates of asthma in the same neighborhood. This was accompanied by a map showing emergency room visits for asthma with data on diesel truck traffic in Oakland. I also wrote an article about a fund to bring healthier food to communities like East Oakland, where liquor stores are more common than grocery stores. These stories were the inspiration and impetus for the map. I have only started to scratch the surface of health and health-care disparities in Oakland; this project has potential to be so much more.","I will use funds to pay for information requests, copying documents and hosting fees for the online project. I would also use funds to travel to communities similar to Oakland demographically, to compare and contrast health disparities and how other cities are responding to the same issues Oakland residents face.","This project is easily sustained when tied to Berkeley’s journalism school and OaklandNorth.net. Students can update databases powering the map as new data becomes available, tied either to Oakland North or the health reporting class. There will always be incoming students to ensure the project is consistently updated."

It can create useful meaning out of Twitter’s ongoing stream of data.","It is oriented toward news and events, it is real time or retrospective, it provides a new layer of Twitter analysis that is not currently available. ","It will work because we are bringing a team of computer scientists, journalists, and academics together to develop a big data tool that is practical and has meaning for multiple audiences. The effort is collaborative. The perspectives diverse. And this fills an existing journalism and research gap.","Journalists, computer scientists, and communication researchers at the University of Missouri.",The design has been drafted and we are utilizing components from several other big data tools being developed by the Reynolds Journalism Institute.,Funds would be used to support additional computer scientists to finalize the protocol development so that the tool can be piloted during the heat of the 2012 U.S. Presidential election.,  We will apply for continued funding and hosting from entities such as the Reynolds Journalism Institute (RJI) and look for journalism partners to pilot and evaluate the tool.
PhD about food environment maps,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25579089616/phd-about-food-environment-maps,,Develop an application for both everyday users and health experts which visualizes food environments i.e. healthy choices in communities.,"The goal is to create a system that can process multi-dimensional category data sets in regards to their geographic position. The system will facilitate in portraying the food environment with its array of healthy food choices,  in order to make this information easier for users to access.",The common geographical apps focussing on nutrition are concerned only with dietary questions. My goal is to develop a system to provide better and more accessible information about food choices in order to improve nutritional habits.,"The importance of the environment concerning nutrition and food habits is well known in literature. Therefore it would be helpful to create a service which supports the user’s daily needs, such as healthy eating and shopping for healthy foods. To achieve such support, you need to narrow the data on your specific topic and find a way to identify the relevant indicators and visualize the multi-dimensional interdependencies on a map. By giving a user an easy way to discern his/her food environment, the user is able to better organize his/her daily routine and integrate healthy food.",I’m a PhD student at the University of Regensburg in Germany. The theme of my dissertation is „Food environment maps exemplarily implemented in a rural area.“ I finished my Master of Engineering in Media Technology and Media Production last October at the University of Applied Sciences (FH) Amberg-Weiden. During my studies I focused on Computer Science and Media. For my PhD I’ve decided to use my knowledge to add as much as I can to offer people a chance to  gain easier access to the data in our world.,"I did research on literature about food environment and health prevention. I started to build a network of researchers and experts to answer the relevant questions about nutrition. Moreover I established access to people to get the programming workload done. I already began the research as part of my PhD, which is connected to a project about empowerment and nutrition at the University of Regensburg. Its general aim  is to sustainably improve nutrition in communities in north eastern Bavaria, Germany, by using empowerment and participative strategies: http://www.epi-regensburg.de/wp/?page_id=1969&preview=true",Through funding I would be able to fast-track the development and to widen the set of data and region. Moreover it would be possible to raise the number opinions of nutrition experts for gaining much more valid data. I could better focus on the logic and category system besides programming a prototype. ,"By creating a generic system, therefore changes in environment can easily be implemented, without a huge amount of programming. Moreover further work on the system could be financed by founding of a non-profit organisation, or by communities or food relevant places itself, like restaurants or bakeries etc that sponsor system improvements.  "

Data is often delivered as cumbersome and inaccessible downloads.  ,"Our project will succeed because it is based on a deep understanding of government entities, nonprofit and media organizations. It will be the first tool to allow entities that cannot afford lobbyists to access elected officials and legislative staff who are crucial to legislative strategy.  Built on the awareness that government transparency is about more than knowing who the elected officials are—it will also offer deep insight into often-opaque bureaucracies with accurate and up to date information. It will liberate organizations to spend more time building relationships and having substantive conversations with the legislature to advance their advocacy goals.","This project is being managed by Maggie Williams, a strategic advisor for legislative advocacy with extensive experience training nonprofits in navigating city and state government more effectively. As a previous advocate and legislative staffer and current board member of the North Star Fund, Maggie is committed to making government more accountable.

Additionally, it generates new data by collecting user-generated photos, videos, and stories. Archaeologists will benefit from unparalleled access to local knowledge, while dry technical data will become open and engaging to wider audiences.","No archaeological project currently allows stakeholders to comment directly, democratically, and in an unfiltered fashion to knowledge about the past, or accommodates creative multimedia and geospatial information in this way.","As a World Heritage Site, Petra has always inspired interest among local communities and worldwide. Using the unique geolocation capabilities of mobile technologies expands and enriches the experience of moving through Petra and its surroundings. Archaeologists at Brown University have over twenty years of research at Petra and a longstanding commitment to open data. We draw inspiration from the success of apps such as the Museum of London’s ‘Street Museum,’ but envision allowing an unprecedented capability for users to add original and innovative content.  Opening conversation between researchers, locals, and the Internet community will inspire fresh enthusiasm for Petra’s heritage.","Brown University has both excavated in Petra’s city center and explored the surrounding countryside, and has developed a complex understanding of life in the region, both past and present. The Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World, together with computation and visualization units at Brown, have the resources and experience to serve as the hub for this endeavor.","To date, massive amounts of high-quality spatial archaeological data have been accumulated. Much of the archival data are already open access using the Open Context platform for web-based research and data publication, while ongoing work employs the Archaeological Recording Kit (ARK), an open source program for the web-based creation and dissemination of archaeological information. Furthermore, the Joukowsky Institute utilizes extensive social media, and so has established global networks of engaged participants. This international community can be put into dialogue with our existing relationships with the local populations of Jordan.","1.       Develop a mobile application and website, including new functionality for existing open access platforms. 2.       Actively promote the involvement of local community members in Jordan by providing technology and training. 3.       Create an open source, accessible, and interactive paradigm that can be adapted to other archaeological and heritage sites.",All archaeological data will be held in perpetuity by Brown University; the application is designed to expand continually and to be self-sustaining. Our goal is to share: we will measure the sustainability of the project by its successful adoption by other archaeological projects.
Students For Solutions: Using Data to Drive Educational Transformation,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25579072952/students-for-solutions-using-data-to-drive-educational,,Students for Solutions puts those who matter the most in education—the students—in the driver’s seat of educational transformation.  ,"Students, with the support of educators and families, will be developed into a youth corps of educational researchers, tasked with using My Voice survey data—collected from hundreds of thousands of their fellow students assessing the conditions that facilitate students’ aspirations and engagement in school—to solve large-scale educational problems.","Innovative uses of technology allow students, their parents, teachers and community to bypass barriers of time, opportunity and awareness, and use data to increase conditions shown to improve student performance.","Placing Student Voice at the heart of our project does not mean asking students more questions, but listening to what they have to say and learning from it. Review of data from over 500,000 student MyVoice responses suggests that when schools become places whose primary purpose is to nurture, support, and inspire students to work toward their dreams, students are more likely to come to school eager and prepared to learn. QISA’s Three Guiding Principles—Purpose, Engagement, and Self Worth - have been shown through the research literature to promote healthy school environments in which students are more likely to succeed.","The Quaglia Institute for Student Aspirations (QISA) leads a consortium of LEAs in California, Massachusetts, Ohio and the UK currently implementing My Voice, with the Pearson Foundation, the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), the School Engagement Trust (SET) in the UK, and Successful Practices Network (SPN) as official partners. QISA provides a dedicated team of field staff supporting capacity building, through both site visits and online collaboration. CLARO Consulting (Community Learning and Resource Optimization) is providing database design and development services.  A Global Advisory Team of students from all sites collaborates with decision-makers to develop their solutions.","We currently support a Global Advisory Team of student leaders in the UK, CA, MA and OH with a suite of online collaborative tools including a prototype of an interactive online database allowing participant investigations of the dataset. These personalized planning tools help students, teachers, parents and administrators to transform these data into actions that support student success in the form of My Academic Action Plans (MAAP). Participants benefit from research in educational psychology that has shown each of the Three Guiding Principles to be malleable, as well as predictive of student success (often in populations of high needs students).","The digital revolution that has reshaped much of society has been late to arrive in the homes and families of our high need students. We will use funding for development costs to adapt tools for mobile access to meet the needs of students, parents and families where they are.",The development costs for the data visualization tools supporting My Academic Action Plans we seek are “one-time” rather than ongoing operational costs. The Students for Solutions model is based on local capacity building to make each local project self-sustaining. We use open-source and Web 2.0 tools to support infrastructure sustainability.

Hackathons are routine among developers, but we add a collaborative comedy writers’ room. Seven-On-Seven with comedians!","With our comedy experience, strong ties to the NYC tech community (we’re physically hosted at betaworks) and our ability to generate press, we can recruit talented participants. We will bolster the existing hackathon model with an idea management process that’s proven reliable at The Onion and beyond, and will culminate in an entertaining live show. Given the election, this project is optimized for maximum public interest, relevance, attention, and good. Comedians are hungry for new outlets. Developers love fun projects. The public needs new ways to participate in its democracy. We’re using satire to better engage and inform.","Baratunde Thurston is a comedian and former director of digital for The Onion. He produced its 2008 election coverage and helped adapt the company’s storytelling to digital platforms. He took two CS courses in college when he didn’t have to.

Craig Cannon is a former Onion graphics editor and Campaign Manager for Baratunde’s bestselling book, How To Be Black. He sometimes goes by the pseudonym “white shadow.” We’ll involve others from the tech and politics communities as needed.","We have researched, attended, observed, and consulted with several existing hack days to understand the process and adapt it to our needs. We’ve also begun identifying possible data sources, APIs, and partners including the Center for Public Integrity, Sunlight Foundation, Twilio, MapBox, Personal Democracy Forum, and Open Secrets. We have anecdotally tested the idea with developers, data scientists, and comedians, all of whom have responded positively. We plan to run a smaller, beta version of the hackathon in late summer not focused on the election and will apply lessons learned there to the Fall version.","Knight funds would lay the foundation for creating an environment that encourages creativity and produces multiple products that make data more engaging and understandable. Specifically: marketing, food and drink for ~100 people across two days, t-shirts, comedy talent, project management, and initial development of winning ideas.","With sponsors and donated resources, we can operate several hackthons a year with limited cash outlays. The Knight-funded hackathon can help prove the model of the comedy hackathon and open us to new funding options. We can bring data to life for companies, schools, non-profits, and more."

Sentiment Analysis Engine for Chinese Social Media,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25579053251/sentiment-analysis-engine-for-chinese-social-media,0,Create an engine that mines China’s Twitter-like Weibo platforms to conduct ongoing sentiment analysis.,·       Enable journalists to identify emerging trends and hidden stories from the tweets of over 500 million Chinese users. ·       Use machine learning to assess user sentiments and assist qualitative and human analysis. ·       Create dynamic list of top opinion leaders and identify most influential topics among these power users.,Current projects focus on what is censored by the Chinese government. Data published by platform operators is limited and skewed by government restrictions and commercial motivations.,"Journalist interest in Chinese social media is growing because it offers the freest avenue of expression for Chinese citizens facing heavy media control. However, journalists currently use a “brute-force” approach to gathering online quotes. Integration of data into Weibo-based reportage is highly sporadic, very basic, and almost exclusively focused on censorship. Because the Weibo platform APIs are open, and fallback options (such as screen captures) are also available, the opportunity exists to conduct systematic, rigorous, data-based sentiment analyses. We wish to integrate such data with the insight and context that human reporting can provide. ","David Wertime, Rachel Lu, and Jimmy Gao met at Harvard Law School and in late 2011 founded TeaLeafNation.com, which mines Chinese social media to generate English-language stories (see q. 6). All have deep experience in China, and Jimmy Gao holds an engineering degree. Approximately 25 others have already contributed to Tea Leaf Nation. Researchers at Hong Kong University have used access to Sina’s API to build Weiboscope (http://research.jmsc.hku.hk/social/search.py/sinaweibo/), which tracks and captures deleted tweets and also tracks popularly re-posted images. But the tool only gathers a limited data set and is not currently able to reach conclusions about online sentiment.","We have built TeaLeafNation.com, which analyzes sentiment in Chinese social media. However, it uses a manual approach, whereby reporters read a large number of tweets on a given topic before reaching a conclusion about general trends in sentiment. We believe adding a rigorous, data-driven element will make our platform more scalable, timely, and useful.","Recruit analysts and developers to help build and test a program that 1) queries Weibo APIs for data such as user profiles, tweets, number of comments and re-tweets, 2) identifies keywords and trending topics among subsets of users, 3) performs sentiment analysis based on natural language.","The cost of building the project is a one-time investment. To maintain and improve it, we plan to license the tool to news organizations, provide bespoke research services, and seek further funding as necessary."

Community Health Analytics: Making Community Health Data Useful,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25578923649/community-health-analytics-making-community-health,700000,Improve a billion lives by enabling governments and organizations to better serve people living in extreme poverty through smarter use of community health data.,"Community health workers—villagers trained to provide essential health services in their communities—are often the first line of care for the billion people worldwide who live on less than a dollar a day. Soon, these health workers will ubiquitously use mobile devices to report on their activities, creating huge amounts of real-time data on health events such as births, illnesses, and hospitalizations. We will create practical tools for understanding and acting upon these data.","Health systems rarely take full advantage of community health data, typically only calculating aggregate statistics for official reports. Metrics are often unclearly defined; data quality is suspect; and analysis is not oriented for action.","Across diverse sectors, data analytics has revolutionized how businesses operate. Health care, however, has lagged behind, due in part to widespread reliance on paper-based information systems. But this is changing. Surprisingly, adoption of electronic health technologies has been fastest in the very settings that lack electricity. Equipped with mobile phones, community health workers in these settings are able to instantaneously and seamlessly report health data to cloud-based servers, forming a robust, distributed “peripheral nervous system.” But in this new data-rich environment, the “brain”—the central system for processing and analyzing information—is missing. Creating this brain will unlock massive potential for understanding community health dynamics and responding appropriately with data-driven interventions.","This project is a partnership between three organizations: Partners In Health (PIH) is a nonprofit organization that works with the governments of 12 countries to support 8,000 community health workers in program contexts ranging from single diseases (HIV, diabetes) to comprehensive primary care. Dimagi is a technology company whose market-leading, open-source mobile health platform, CommCare, is being used by 3,000 community health workers in 15 countries, with a user base expected to grow to 25,000 in three years. Researchers at Harvard Business School (HBS) partner with governments in developing countries to develop analytic tools and implement randomized experiments to understand and improve the performance of community health workers.","Across key dimensions of data analytics, the project partners are at the vanguard of making community health data more useful. This project will enable the partners to come together formally to build an integrated community health analytics system. Metrics: PIH and Dimagi lead the Maternal Concept Lab, a consortium that is creating a concept dictionary of core terminology, indicators, and standards for community-based maternal health programs. Data Quality: PIH and HBS are developing tools to improve the quality of data collected by community health workers, using methodologies such as Lot Quality Assurance Sampling and digit-based statistical tests. Analytics: Dimagi and HBS are developing data-processing algorithms that allow programs to rapidly analyze community health data, as well as analytic models for explaining the performance of community health workers based on individual and community characteristics.","In at least three countries in Africa and South Asia, we will create and deploy a unified, technology-agnostic framework and toolkit for community health analytics. This system will include: interoperable indicators and standards; tools and methodologies for data quality assessment; and “dashboard” and “analysis” software applications that make sense of community health data with techniques such as visualization, cluster analysis, and regression. Key project stages will include design, development, piloting, deployment, and evaluation.",This project is catalytic; its true impact will emerge as governments and organizations adopt our open-source tools in large-scale community health programs that are independently funded. Further development will be carried out by a development community that will emerge organically as more organizations adopt the system.

SocialCoach: Helping people improve their social skills online,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25578838212/socialcoach-helping-people-improve-their-social-skills,,      An online platform that allows humans to practice their interview/public speaking skills and get real-time feedback on their nonverbal behaviors.  ,"1)      1)      In face-to-face interactions, our subconscious nonverbal behaviors (e.g., eye contacts, smiles, intonation, and pauses) contain more information than the spoken words. What if we could get live visualization of our nonverbal behavior as we practice certain social scenarios (e.g., job interviews) online for our self-discovery and self-reflection? ",      There is no tool available that can sense nonverbal behavior online in real time for free where users are in control of their interaction and data. ,"     There two main challenges: 1) Technical: building the algorithms that can sense nonverbal behavior in real-time, which has already been done as part of our research. The funds being solicited are for deploying the system online for people to interact and improve their public speaking/social skills. 2) Building a community: The heart of human relationships is interaction. This tool will allow an opportunity for people to better understand their subconscious nonverbal behavior objectively while having full control of the interaction and their data. ","1   Sensing of nonverbal behavior is an active project of Mohammed Ehsan Hoque who is a PhD student at the Affective Computing Lab headed by Prof. Rosalind Picard of MIT Media Lab. Affective Computing Group is the pioneer of developing systems that can sense nonverbal behavior in difficult real-life conditions. We have partnered with Blue Planet Training, a company that specializes into providing public speaking services with innovative lessons. We are collaborating with Amy Cuddy from Harvard Business School, Jeffrey Cohn from University of Pittsburgh, who are world’s leading experts in nonverbal behavior understanding, and recognition. ","     The nonverbal sensing part of this project has already been developed. We have algorithms implemented that can sense facial expressions, and paralinguistic cues of speech (e.g., intonation, pauses, loudness and speaking rate) in real time. We have some aspects of the visualization developed, which can plot the nonverbal behavior back to the user in real time. ","     The current prototype that we have works on a local computer. We will use the news challenge funds to obtain servers space to deploy our system online. In particular, we will work closely with an expert who can guide us through the issues related to scalability so that some day we could serve the entire population of this world. We will also collaborate with graphic designers and HCI researchers who can give feedback on our existing data visualization schema and perhaps, help us redesign some aspects of it. ","     We will use the funding to develop momentum to get this project off the ground. Our only cost will be setting up the scalable server storage. Given the funds to develop the platform, the project could sustain on its own, or even generate revenue being a fun, interactive and useful site to visit. "

Do you know where to check and where to find the stats? Which source you can use that is reliable over time? What difference does population change make? Is it a false comparison or in a context only experts seem to know? Our project will answer these questions. This is something people are already calling for","Official sources are limited — clunky, fragmented and lacking explanations; API-less and isolated. Even Google isn’t good at this. We are offering information not data, explained and easy to use, but also structured and developer-friendly.","We know first-hand the potential impact of this project because so much of the factchecking we do is about problems with datasets like crime statistics — how difficult they are to find and understand, and how much scope there is for under the radar misuse. Our project will make it far easier to place meaningful trust in data. The software to make this work is hard, but we have working code that solves the hardest problems. We have prototyped against a variety of complex datasets. Our design is robust and versatile enough to cope with a very wide range of data and commentary.","Full Fact, a non-profit, is the UK’s only independent factchecking organisation. Our “brilliant and comprehensive” “penetrating and sober” “must-read” etc. analysis is regularly cited by experts, politicians and the media. Our statistics adviser was Director of Policy for the UK’s Office for National Statistics and then Chief of Staff to the Chair of the UK Statistics Authority. We’re experts in the sources, uses and abuses of data. The initial database design was done by a specialist and refined through testing with different datasets. Development so far has been done by our Director as time allowed. The project needs dedicated staff now.","The major thing we’ve built with our network is a rare expertise in relevant statistics – this is not just a software project. In our prototype and further development, we have solved the two hardest problems: storing arbitrary data meaningfully, and getting it into the database easily, adding complex datasets in minutes. We are within striking distance of a ‘minimum viable product’ for launch. From there we could build up our planned functionality fairly rapidly. The other large piece of work is adding the data and information to our system — a task for both dedicated staff and the crowd.",Mainly to hire two staff: a developer to complete version 1 and then develop the software further and a curator to work with our networks adding data and information. The rest will go to supporting our other staff to help with content and promotion.,By commercialising it: the platform itself for data publishers; the database content for raw data users; and products and services based on the tool itself. Costs will fall anyway once the software is feature-complete and loaded with important datasets because the main task then will be keeping it up to date.

The current BOE is an underused file repository with high value, since it collects every government decision. Performing automated and manual data mining, we will identify the main potential data sets with public interest and structure them. For the first time, journalists, campaigners or even companies will be able to systematically re-use data of public aid, government appointments or approved legislation. We will develop an open source data mining tool scalable and applicable to other sources of official information, such as official journals in Europe.","Fundación Ciudadana Civio is a non-profit devoted to promote engaged citizenry through transparency and data openness.

Citizens can ACCESS data, CREATE and PUBLISH applications and mashups.","By eliminating barriers to entry, Criik offers a solution powered by public data for transparency. It’s a data catalog & FOI request workflow, as simple to manage as an email account.","Because it’s quick, easy, free, and simple. It’s the solution many organizations need in order to comply with increasingly expanding FOI and transparency regulations. It’s adaptable to small and large organizations, with a focus on countries whose governments move slower than laws. In Latin America, laws regulate how central public bodies publish their data. In the short term, we anticipate other organizations will also be required to abide by these laws. Additionally, Criik offers this data to the developer community. Finally, the platform hosts the hundreds of civic applications these developers created.","Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente, a Chilean based Latin American NGO that develops web technologies as a means to foster transparency, fight corruption, and promote citizen engagement. A collaboration of developers, designers, journalists, lawyers, sociologists, and political scientists are all behind Criik.org.

We will personalize politics.  ","Lawmaking is a time consuming, and often esoteric process. We believe that this project will lift the veil and allow everyday citizens to monitor and engage in the legislative process. The project will create apps, mobile-compliant sites and an online database that interfaces not only in our dedicated ecosystem, but also with the networks (e.g. Facebook) that citizens live in everyday. We want to make being an active citizen as frictionless as possible.  ","The concept was created by University of Florida undergraduates Aundre Larrow and Jessica Oliver. They are working with UF’s 21st Century News Lab, as well as the College’s public media (NPR/PBS) stations WUFT, and UF’s Division of Multimedia Properties. We will also utilize our partnerships with other UF departments, such as the Digital Worlds Institute (http://www.digitalworlds.ufl.edu/).","The idea for this project came from the College of Journalism’s spring 2012 “What If News Challenge.” (http://www.whatifnewschallenge.com/2012/04/23/hey-bill-making-politics-personal/)  The project is still in the conceptualization phase, and we are seeking assistance and resources to make this project a reality.  ","The grant will allow us to bring in a full-time developer and project leader, legal expert consultation, as well as fund graduate students to assist in the development and execution of the project.

This information, however, has never been organized, and often remains hard to find. Our project is designed to efficiently compile and display scattered event data in a simple, searchable, user-friendly way.","Our project’s global scope provides several distinct advantages over localized efforts to collect and display event data, while our location-based platform emphasizes where real activism takes place: in the streets.","Our project will work partly because it’s crowdsourced, making a comprehensive global listing of events into a fully realizable goal.  Our solution is also location-based, giving it an inherent advantage in promoting offline action when compared to platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.  Additionally it fills a long-held and growing need for a tool to consolidate the multitude of efforts for peace and social justice, especially following a renewed interest in activism since Occupy Wall Street and last year’s Arab Spring.  Finally, the idea is very simple, making it easy to convince people to use.","Lokashakti founder Will Travers has a degree in nonviolence from the University of Michigan, and has spent time working under Gene Sharp - the world’s leading authority on strategic nonviolent action.  Our website was built pro bono by Benjamin Lipkin, who holds a Master’s in Fine Arts from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  Our volunteer staff also includes two web development interns, four office interns, and a three-member advisory board.  Finally, our crowdsourced platform allows site users to participate by adding organizations, projects, places, and events, expanding opportunities for activists and potential activists alike.","Through thousands of volunteer hours over the past two years, we’ve built the infrastructure for a non-commercial, open-source social media site based upon the Joomla! CMS, allowing us to crowdsource the submission of organizations and events.  The beta version launched in April, however, requires a number of improvements to make event submission and sharing as easy as possible - key to growing our user base.  With the iCal standard, Lokashakti.org can be made fully compatible with existing local calendars and organization websites, serving as a home for scattered data and making it more accessible to people around the world.","With News Challenge funding we would hire three full-time web developers to enhance our existing events system, integrate it with the online tools people already use, and develop a mobile application to expand opportunities for data collection and retrieval.  We would also hire someone full-time for marketing and promotion.","After funding expires, the amount of development work will decrease significantly as we turn more towards marketing and promotion.  While further foundational funding covers ongoing costs, we’ll begin to employ various revenue collection tools on our site such as ticketing commission and ebook sales."

Research shows that 75% of Americans under 20 consider the environment their top priority and therefore show a greater propensity to engage in projects that address environmental problems. Unfortunately, the same research says that young people lack the skills and information to be effective. EarthEcho uses research-based educational strategies (service-learning/inquiry based education) to build the skills and knowledge that young people need. And, we have a track record of success.  Over the last two years we have engaged 18,000 students in developing action projects. ","EarthEcho International is a leading environmental nonprofit committed to youth engagement and action.

NewsDiffs! Taking a Knight Mozilla MIT Hackathon Project into the Real World,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25577648516/newsdiffs-taking-a-knight-mozilla-mit-hackathon,,"We want to take NewsDiffs.org and create a standard, open source system for the online archiving of news articles and public interest websites to solve the “version control” problem in journalism and politics.","1) NewsDiffs creates data. It automatically archives versions of news articles and web pages that otherwise disappear and creates a historical record (For example, how the New York Times Mubarak story was updated after he was still alive). 2) NewsDiffs makes data available to others. Right now everything exists in a single (very long) web page on NewsDiffs. But our ideal would be to make the feed and database available for others to pull from as they need for other applications. 3) Data availability promotes transparency, accountability, and creativity (new uses we can’t even imagine). One site has already used NewsDiffs to analyze New York Times coverage. And the New York Times public editor offices uses the site for research. ","NewsDiffs.org has been called “brilliant” and “awesome”  precisely because it is a good proof of concept. It tracks news web sites (which change rapidly enough to be interesting) and makes the information available for others to peruse and upvote. It is inspired in part by ChangeTracker from ProPublica, which monitored WhiteHouse.gov site starting in 2009, but has since been retired, in part, because of difficulty in maintenance.","1) It is already working. Just needs to work more and bigger.2) There is a clear demand. Version tracking is sorely needed in online journalism. Luckily, this is largely a solved problem in programming. The New York Times Public Editor wrote about this archiving problem last year. In it, Jill Abramson, the executive editor is quoted as saying it’s unrealistic to preserve an “immutable, permanent record of everything we have done.” NewsDiffs shows that existing technological tools allow a solid approximation. They just have to be assembled.3) We are not pushing boundaries from a technology standpoint, since it largely uses open source tools that already exist: Git (which allows version control for articles), Mergely (compare changes side by side), Beautiful Soup (a Python library which helps to smoothly parse Web sites) and Twitter Bootstrap (which makes everything pretty). It is just a creative way to sew them all together.4) It’s open source on Github, so others can contribute. This can be a good way to introduce concepts of programming to journalism and newsrooms.  ","Currently: Eric Price, Jennifer 8. Lee and Greg Price put up a minimal viable product from the hackathon. Greg and Eric, who are brothers with degrees from MIT, have both placed highly in the world ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest. Greg works for Tddium and Eric is getting his PhD in theoretical computer science from MIT.. Future:  1) The Poynter Institute, where Jenny has served on the National Advisory Board, which can host the developers, develop the courses, and drive it to sustainability. 2) Hacks/Hackers will use its global network to promote the project and courses. 3) Others. The project currently sits on Github. So anyone can take it and patch and fork it as need be. We’ve already see our first outside commit (to fix a typo)! ","NewsDiffs.org. A proof-of-concept site thrown together in 38 hours as part of the Knight Mozilla MIT OpenNews hackathon. The site has already drawn reasonable Twitter, media and industry attention around the world (in Russian even) in the last few days. We are currently tracking nytimes.com, cnn.com and politico.com. More scrapers can be added after Eric finishes his paper for a conference.  In the three days since NewsDiffs was made public, people are already using NewsDiffs data to analyze reporting.  ",""," - Create a subscription white-label, private version for news organizations with advance functionality to use to track and archive their own changes in their websites.  - Create a freemium service for tracking political and government sites, available for journalists and other organizations. It would be a fixed fee per website tracked (because of custom parsers needed), with potential bulk discounts, and support. (People can also use the open source code to build their own versions, but no support). - “Learn to program” class fees using NewsDiffs as a way introduce journalists/newsrooms to concepts of parsing Web sites, open source, forking, Github, version control, front-end development, back-end development."

This data is then compiled and released through individualized data driven dashboards for each stakeholder that are accessible and actionable by utilities, governments, funding agencies, NGOs and the media.","WASH SMS was designed by users, ensures information is publicly displayed and accessible in individualized dashboards, uses technology accessible to the poor, and ensures that data leads to demonstrable change.","Information to compel better governance and planning in the urban water sector is sorely lacking. The urban poor lack water and sanitation yet often have a mobile phone. In developing country cities, the urban poor wake up not knowing where they’ll get water or use a toilet; utilities don’t have information on water sources and needs; and governments and aid organizations lack information to compel better services. WASH SMS creates crowd-sourced data in the form of maps and reports for transparency and bottom-up accountability to improve service delivery, responsiveness, and planning for future vulnerabilities due to disasters and climate change.","WASH SMS is being developed by an international network of partners. Pacific Institute (www.pacinst.org) works to meet basic human and environmental needs in water and sanitation. Nexleaf Analytics (www.nexleaf.org) develops mobile phone solutions for the environment and public health. Local NGOs ensure community involvement, system relevancy, and technical sustainability. In Indonesia, we are partnering with PATTIRO (www.pattiro.org) to address water resource and service issues.  In India, we are partnering with Transparent Chennai (www.transparentchennai.com) to address urban sanitation challenges. In each location, from the beginning we partner directly with affected stakeholders and communities to develop the systems.","The open-source WASH SMS system is currently being developed through pilot projects in two Indonesian cities. We’ve conducted comprehensive learning sessions with urban poor communities, water utilities, government agencies, informal water providers, NGOs, and the media to define priority issues, information needs, and input and display formats. We’ve demonstrated the Alpha version in a Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue and gained feedback on system interactions and display preferences. We are now developing the Beta version, with customized dashboards and complementary offline operational procedures, through three rounds of testing before the public pilot launch in early 2013. Our partnerships with utilities will ensure that the data leads to change.","Current funding is restricted to Indonesia. News Challenge funds are critical to scale up WASH SMS to other countries, develop partnerships with local and international media organizations to use and report on data generated in the system, and develop replicable open source code for other urban services issues.","Working with ICT and governance experts we’re developing a multi-faceted sustainability plan: Indonesian community, WASH and technical organizations will partner to take ownership of and maintain the system; utilities or local governments will financially support the system; and urban poor residents have demonstrated willingness to pay for messaging costs."

The community is there. The technology is ready. Specifically there is a clear need for the kinds of lightweight but useful protocols and formats for doing the activities mentioned above. Second, consensus needs to come from a community not just a single vendor or organization and the user and developer community is now developed enough to take this on and make it happen. Third, technology and especially web technology has reached the point where this is both feasible and needed - be that in terms of standards, use of HTTP and REST, browser maturity, or, in terms of ad-hoc development in tools that is ripe for “standardization”.","The current dataprotocols.org site combines existing proposals and material from engineers at Open Knowledge Foundation, ScraperWiki, Code for America, Knight Grantees and others. Turning this into a real community and process would need some coordination from a specific organization(s). It is planned that the Open Knowledge Foundation would play this role, at least initially with the aim is to develop a small active steering group of contributing organizations and individuals. Work at the Open Knowledge Foundation will be led by Rufus Pollock, co-Founder of the Foundation, and David Raznick technical lead of the CKAN project.","We have set up DataProtocols.org website and a mailing list. Though neither have been formally announced or circulated the site has already collected a variety of initial proposals at dataprotocols.org including ideas for data syncing between different services, querying, exchange formats and record linkage. Likewise the mailing list already has subscribers from around the open data community. While work is at a very early stage and all ideas are in need refinement and discussion, these plans represent an understanding and approach developed over several years and we believe there is now a shared understanding that for data ecosystem to become sustainable we need simple, open, and commonly agreed approaches to standard issues such reconciliation, syncing, querying etc.","Fund a dedicated staff member to act as community steward. $110k Engage lead experts on specific topic areas (work may be pro-bono) $30k Sprint workshops on particular areas and implementations. $35k (travel, venue etc) Support prototype implementations and validators – specs without implementations are of little value $75k","There is no code or service to maintain here - rather it will be a community and a process. This will require little financial resource to sustain. Furthermore, if successful an active community will be in existence which would both carry the project forward and provide a membership base if funding is required."

But the evolving political and reputational risks were captured in rapid local news cycles. Communicating these risks in a timely, concise, compelling, evidence-based manner to the international community will allow them to respond more quickly, and will help protect the vulnerable populations that are the clients of microfinance institutions.  We have direct access to the audience for this analysis: more than 100,000 members of the microfinance industry access our information each month.","Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX) and MicroCapital, both US-based organizations, will partner on the project. We share a commitment to information transparency, connecting international investors with institutions that provide financial services to the poor through microfinance. MIX collects and displays data on the performance of microfinance institutions, covering 2,000+ providers in 110 developing countries. MicroCapital provides a candid voice for microfinance through its daily news feed and monthly digest, covering news, events, and research summaries. Both organizations have existing staff and partner networks in local markets and strong global audiences to help disseminate the results of the project.","We’ve tested this with a microfinance news timeline for Kyrgyzstan (https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S479278ggS6) - a market that many microfinance investors think is in trouble. The data indicate that things are ‘not that bad’, but there are protests in the streets and suicides in-country. We seek to bridge this gap between Western and local perspectives by looking at local news sources and connecting these with trend data from investors and microfinance institutions. It will be straightforward to replicate the same structure in other countries.","- Local news monitors in 5 - 10 key countries, either our staff or in-country partners, with an emphasis on local-language skills.- A central resource to consolidate news and data and track themes and sentiments. - A platform to disseminate and visualize the results, likely leveraging existing tools.","We will focus on minimizing running costs, especially through mutually-beneficial relationships with local news monitors.

Fracking Alerts makes the most important info easy to find on an interactive map, and easy to get via automatic email or RSS feed. Subscribers will get a crucial heads up when drilling is coming to their neighborhood.","Automatically scraping data daily from government websites keeps Alerts dynamic, fresh and relevant. Focus on local, simplified information holds Alerts below the “overwhelm” threshold and keeps users engaged.","People want to know about changes to their local environment. The possible negative impacts (air and water pollution, habitat loss, traffic, noise) from drilling and fracking are raising concerns nationwide. Showing when and where drilling is occurring - or about to occur - is key to recruiting citizen engagement. Fracking Alerts gives users up-to-the-minute “when, what and where” data they want, so they can decide if it’s time to get involved in the issue. Users can restrict the Alerts information to their self-selected areas of interest so they don’t get overloaded with irrelevant data they’re not interested in.","Fracking Alerts is headed up by Paul Woods, CTO of SkyTruth. Paul has 25 years of commercial software development experience from Internet startups CareerBuilder and GeoStellar to online teaching tools at Johns Hopkins.  In 2011 Paul moved from the SkyTruth board into a full time role to manage the expansion of SkyTruth’s IT capacity.   SkyTruth uses satellite images and other geospatial data to investigate and illuminate environmental issues. Our work in 2010 revealed the BP oil spill was much larger than reported. Our subsequent investigations show that “day-to-day” pollution caused by offshore drilling is much worse than officially acknowledged.","Alerts.skytruth.org has 650 subscribers.  Alerts aggregates fracking data for PA and WV (permits, drilling reports, violations) and delivers these events filtered by location via interactive map (embeddable), email, RSS, JSON API, and raw data download.   Alerts includes: ·         Web scrapers extracting data daily from state and federal portals ·         Database storing incident reports in standard format ·         Webservice API for querying the database ·         Email subscription and notification module ·         RSS publishing module   Local watershed monitoring groups in PA and WV use our system to know when new fracking is planned and sharing our reports with other concerned citizens.","Add new data sources: Expand to all states that have fracking.   Software development: Hire developer to improve UI, subscription with customizable filters, call to action.   Promotion: Hire outreach coordinator to engage users and other orgs, solicit feedback to improve system.  Expand to average 1000 subscribers per state.","Maintenance costs will be low.  Partner orgs act as Data Custodians (e.g. Carnegie Mellon is interested in maintaining PA data), future joint funding projects are likely.    We will use the system to solicit contributions from users, timing our donation requests to follow the most-shared (and most impactful) reports."

Twitter is a treasure-trove of real-time conversation on every imaginable topic. There are fascinating insights & trends about what matters in each of our communities that simply haven’t been surfaced. This is data that directly reflects interests of city residents and that speaks more broadly than just those citizens who already engage with government, or mention a specific bill by number or politician by name.  It will bring our communities and elected officials closer to pressing community concerns. Our existing user base will immediately become users of this new service and the immediacy of the insights — “People in Detroit talk about unemployment 80% more than the national average” — will drive viral adoption and engagement with officials. City hub page titles as, “What Matters in Philadelphia”, “What Matters in Chicago”, etc.","The Participatory Politics Foundation created and runs OpenCongress, the most-visited non-profit website in the country for tracking the U.S. Congress. OpenCongress receives up to 1 million visits per month and has a user community of more than 300,000. Our founding team also created Miro, Amara (Universal Subtitles), and Fight for the Future.  We have deep experience in political organizing and product development.  We know how to drive engagement — OpenCongress received more than 133,000 user comments on three unemployment bills in the 110th & 111th Congresses.  Miro and Amara each have millions of monthly users.  Fight for the Future has an email list of 3 million people.

It’s not managed to maximize positive outcomes for their reintroduction into the community and society. Compilation, analysis and easy-to-understand presentation of existing data surrounding reentry services offers ex-offenders and their helpmates better access and information  for successful reentry.","No comprehensive network or database exists for ex-offenders to access information and services, or establish outside or inside learning networks, prior to leaving prison. Only piecemeal programs are available.","Access before release from prison to a comprehensive, centralized private social network, staffed with appropriate counselors, would provide data on programs, services and contacts that could improve successful reentry. Small, experimental programs (e.g., Delray Beach, FL) proved the usefulness of a small scale network. Reentry has been repeatedly unsuccessful when such networks are unavailable. This project proposes bringing such a network “to scale” and to be comprehensive with data on employment, housing, health, money, continuing education, technical training, counseling, and family, friends and released ex-offenders. Offenders would have time to prepare in advance of release, making more successful transitions.","Aside from one known small-scale network (e.g., Delray Beach, FL), current research revealed no ex-offender reentry social networks on the scale we envision. Google recently launched a soc-net aimed at ex-offenders of violent extremist groups. A small UK soc-net connects women offenders with others. We have not found evidence of the type of social network that brings together many social, psychological, physical, economic and personal networks to focus solely on preparing the ex-offender for societal reentry and provides a one-stop shop-with diverse, rich data content and connections to help promote safe and productive reentry.","We currently have a conceptual model for a reentry network that was created through a previous foundation grant. As a concept, it requires building from ground up. We’ve prepared for support of a network by appropriate state and local government agencies to provide a working model that establishes the needed metrics to gauge success to deliver more “qualified” ex-offenders into society and showcasing a cost-effective model for broader adoption among states and participating organizations.","For a state-wide model, catalog existing ex-offender services and delivery processes; identify public, private and NFP service providers; market project participation; enable appropriate internet capabilities to offenders ; address institutional, legal and political requirements with state officials; and, build a working model for replication","We envision financial support will come primarily from the state and local government agencies, qualifying participating organizations as a membership fees, and small, future stipends from ex-offender participants for the benefits they receive.

Ours have been developed with journalists’ active involvement, and with documents by and about government in mind.","In its six-year history, Sunlight has frequently grappled with overwhelming quantities of unstructured text: everything from state and federal legislation to regulatory comments to Elena Kagan’s Clinton Administration-era emails. The tools we’ve built to make sense of this flood of data have proven to be powerful and flexible: finding overlapping laws, detecting advocacy campaigns and illuminating how messaging changes over millions of words. These tools presently require technical expertise. We wish to broaden their usefulness.

By working with Sunlight’s in-house reporters and focusing on specific rulemakings, we’ve been able to figure out how to use technology to help journalists whose stories might otherwise be derailed by a flood of data. Once the internal tool has been completed and polished, the next step will be to generalize it and add functionality that makes it easy for anyone to add documents and conduct their own analyses.",Knight’s support would let us extend our prototype into an accessible tool that journalists could use to process document sets without developers’ assistance. We plan to showcase the tool with stories that have been reported with its help. And some funds will be used for outreach and training of journalists.,"After development is complete, ongoing costs will consist of hosting and occasional maintenance. Sunlight expects to be able to support both through core funds. And the code for the project will be open source, allowing other developers to offer enhancements (or sustain it if Sunlight is hit by a meteorite)."

The True Cost of Community Crime,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25575925904/the-true-cost-of-community-crime,100000,"Determine “true costs” of crime using socio-economic indicators, e.g., unemployment, education, healthcare, government assistance, measuring high-crime areas in U.S. communities.",State and local responses to crime should be consistent with responses to other socio-economic “ills.” Concentrated crime areas are not believed to affect a community as a whole. We believe data will show a community-wide economic drain results from high crime areas and requires more effective responses and assistance programs.,"Responses to community crime are usually reactive – more social programs/services. Considering crime as an economic challenge to a municipality’s financial well-being can create different, more proactive and broad-based community responses. ","Challenges that affect an entire community’s economy and well-being, e.g. unemployment, healthcare, education, teen pregnancy, single-parents, and government assistance programs receive a community-wide response.  In contrast, the response to crime is usually isolated to the area where the criminal activity is concentrated and comes primarily from residents, organizations active there and government rather than from the entire community.  Areas of high crime are “ground zero” for most social ills. Connecting the indicators to make an economic argument to address crime as a community-wide economic challenge can change a community’s response to crime.","We know of no organization currently working on gathering and correlating data about crime and social/economic ills in particular neighborhoods. The National Council of Crime and Delinquency (NCCD), agencies of the state of Florida and local law enforcement agencies have some data but have not analyzed, displayed or packaged it in ways that could help policy-makers structure programs and muster broad-based responses to the problem.","We are soliciting data from Fort Myers, Florida, a pilot community on track to set a new homicide record above its 2011 total —its current record year. Homicides are concentrated within two adjacent zip codes which contain most of the city’s impoverished neighborhoods. Ninety-percent of the victims have criminal records. A call has gone out to the community to stop the violence, led by the local newspaper and additional coverage coming from electronic media. Yet, a community-wide response has been minimal, partly because no data-based information and analysis is available to “tell the real story” and generate progressive action.","Hiring a project manager to collect, enter and analyze the data; purchasing data sets and technology where needed; and contracting with research assistance from an area university.

By using specific datasets to answer even just five or six types of questions we can put some of the awesome government transparency efforts out there to work.,The narrative behind even the most dynamic visualizations and reports is often determined by the author. In the examples where this isn’t the case (e.g. Wolfram Alpha / Siri) the tools have no real understanding of government.,"People are getting comfortable with the idea that you can ask computers questions using natural language. The technology behind Poliri is non-trivial, but remember: the point is that questions are formulaic (e.g. “what does X say about Y” or “what is the history of Z”). Poliri will start off by only being able to answer a few templated questions through reports and visualizations tied to live, structured data.","The 2012 Knight-Mozilla Fellows: Dan Schultz, Mark Boas, Cole Gillespie, Laurian Gridinoc, and Nicola Hughes.

Furthermore, its usage on Wikipedia will distribute and advertise external datasets visibly to a wide public, including attribution.","Some projects in this area are DBpedia, Google’s Freebase, or Yago. Wikidata, backed by Wikimedia, differs by being all of the following: independent, editable, providing stable identifiers, and sustainable funding.","The major challenge when creating a common repository of identifiers is not software but social: will the project attract an editor community, will it have sufficient independence and sustainability to be used by stakeholders? By bootstrapping the incentive architecture through Wikipedia we expect to engage an editor community. By being an integral part of the Wikimedia ecosystem we also build on the existing excellent reputation of Wikimedia for being unbiased and sustainable. Reputable upstream partners from the news domain have already committed to use and propagate Wikidata identifiers in their products, thus being disseminated to thousands of news outlets.","Wikimedia’s mission is to provide everyone with free access to the sum of all knowledge: its most prominent projects are Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons. The German chapter of Wikimedia started working on Wikidata in April 2012 with a team of twelve. For this project we will collaborate with New York Times, Press Association, BBC, and dpa and others to enhance their products through the use of Wikidata, all major players with a huge impact in the news domain. The work of this consortium can genuinely reduce overlapping work in the media industry by providing a unified approach towards maintaining identifiers.","By the start of the suggested new project Wikidata will have launched and created an identifier repository with an expected 3 million entities of interest based on Wikipedia articles, as well as a knowledge graph connecting them. It will provide unique and stable identifiers, linked open data published with the identifiers, and will be exposing the data in Wikipedia. As of the submission date, the first phase of the project is almost finished, allowing the creation of identifiers based on Wikipedia. The project is developed as open source and reporting to the public continuously. We expect to launch this summer.","The funds will be used mainly for development, but also for outreach, use cases and demonstrators with the organizations mentioned above (NYT, PA, BBC, dpa). By funding the existing Wikidata development team we will start from the first day with a fully functional team to create the newly suggested functionalities.","For the consortium the identifier repository will become an integral part of their mission well beyond the project duration. As a Wikimedia project, operations will be sustained by regular donations. Development of new functionalities are planned to be funded by additional major donations, so far from ai², GBMF, and Google."

Public Information Workspace – PINFO ,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25573934636/public-information-workspace-pinfo,,"Through PINFO, we will establish a collaborative workspace in which we can curate, explore and amplify public data for a broad audience. ","Local data is available but often exceptionally difficult to access. The Amplification Project (www.amplificationproject.org) will use PINFO resources to lead workspace users through analyzing and applying data to their work. We will then collaborate with media and other NGO partners to disseminate that analysis digitally, in visually meaningful ways.","Through each partner’s area of expertise, PINFO will provide a workspace to extract context that is missing from data banks that currently exist.  At PINFO, data will be transformed and amplified.","It works for two reasons. First, too many of our best data miners – nonprofits, journalists, civic activists, academics – lack the time, support and resources to scrape all but the most readily available data sets. We will provide the capacity to dig deeper and extract a narrative. Second, New Jersey’s arcane open records laws hinder information-gathering. It takes expertise and precision to work around public information offices, especially in state agencies, to obtain the public records that contain the most useful data. We believe fostering cooperation will allow for the deepest exploration of the broadest collection of data.","The public information workspace is a seminal effort within the Amplification Project, in partnership with TownStats.org, the Dodge Foundation, NJ Spotlight and the Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University.  The principals at the Amplification Project bring the expertise needed for PINFO to succeed. •           Founder Richard Greenberg is a social justice policy expert with nonprofit management experience. •           Deborah Howlett is an accomplished journalist who served as a senior communications strategist for a governor. •           Nicole Corre is a data expert with a Masters in Public Policy. •           Daniel D’Alonzo is a digital marketing expert. •           TownStats.org creator Mark Magyar is a fiscal policy expert with a top database developer in Michael Fedorochko.  Montclair State University’s Matt Frankel leads The Center for Cooperative Media, a news collaborative funded by the Dodge Foundation, and has partnered with digital media outlets that include NJ Spotlight, NJTV, WBGO, WHYY and WNYC. ","The creators of TownStats.org used a small grant to aggregate basic municipal finance data for easy comparison by users; PINFO will facilitate comparison of a broad range of data sets by state, county and municipality, and over the course of years.   Other segmented data banks exist, but each operates for the specific benefit of its creator. For example, the state’s YourMoney.NJ.gov shares data, but only data deemed useful in driving a narrative that benefits the incumbent administration. Our goal is to reach beyond political purpose, and to use the data to craft an array of narratives that foster awareness and motivate people to participate in their government.","Funding from the News Challenge will allow the Amplification Project to bring in experts needed to begin aggregating and curating the public information workspace, as well as an outreach director to manage the current cooperative efforts and to foster other collaborations that will ultimately allow PINFO to succeed.","We will build off of our existing partnerships with the Dodge Foundation, The Center for Cooperative Media, and other partnerships cultivated through PINFO. There is also sufficient commercial appeal to create partnerships with for-profit partners – news outlets are one example – that will provide much of the revenue to sustain the venture beyond start-up. "

To ensure adoption, we’ll embed j-coders into nine influential newsrooms to help deploy / integrate the toolsets. ","We’re not inventing yet more new gadgets - we’re instead plugging the gaps and harmonizing operability between existing, proven toolsets, for enterprise-level deployment and mass adoption: as a MobileActive.org for data journalism.","We have a three-part model. First, we aggregate existing ‘best of class’ data tools, bundle them into packages for specific newsroom tasks / workflow solutions, and then we build the APIs and other interoperability features necessary to ensure they work as a seamless & frictionless suite of tools. Second, we embed data wranglers into thought-leader newsrooms, in four-month stints, to deploy the toolsets and help news teams integrate them into editorial workflow. That translates to nine newsrooms per yr. Third, our central jDEV team helps pioneering news teams to source, structure, and narrate flagship data stories to help produce proof-of-concept.","African open data and data journalism pioneer, Justin Arenstein, will manage the project. Arenstein is co-founder of DataDesk’s host organisation, the Investigative Dashboard, consults for Google and ICFJ on data journalism, and is spearheading the rollout of 20 HacksHackers chapters in Africa, as well as data bootcamps and various digital newsroom pilot projects. Open Institute, which was central to Kenya’s successful open data launch, is co-managing the jDEV team based at Kenya’s 88mph tech accelerator. Africa’s largest ‘union’ of media companies, the African Media Initiative, plus HacksHackers and the new African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR) will all disseminate the resulting toolsets.","Investigative Dashboard has been offering forensic investigative research and document analysis for hundreds of international journalists since 2010. The early beta website is currently under redevelopment. AMI and Open Institute, in partnership with the World Bank, have just recruited four programmers for the jDEV team plus five j-coders for embedding into newsrooms as a Code4Kenya pilot (using a hybrid Mozilla OpenNews / Code4America model). The pilot will serve as proof-of-concept for DataDesk’s proposed wider geographic footprint. DataDesk has secured preliminary ‘in principle’ pledges of collaboration from DocumentCloud, ScraperWiki, mySociety (Alaveteli), Panda, and other tools earmarked for the ‘news stack’.  ","The crux of the project is to build / re-engineer interoperability into existing toolsets, and then to prove that they can be integrated into mainstream newsroom workflow systems. DataDesk will therefore appoint three staff developers, in Kenya (for cost purposes) at $5,000/month each for 12 months. DataDesk will also appoint three data wranglers to be embedded in newsrooms across Africa, East Europe, and the Middle East on four-month stints over 1yr at $5,000/month. The balance of the budget will be used to build the portal, for travel, workshops, and support.","The project is designed to have a finite life. It’ll create a suite of optimised toolsets, will embed their use in thought-leader newsrooms, and will establish the core jDEV team. At the end of the grant, the team will be absorbed into ID, while the toolsets will be transferred into custodianship by ANCIR & HacksHackers."

Connecting APIs, RSS feeds, and social media an increasing range of environmental data will be made available for perusal and analysis within one simple search environment that aims to become the first stop for data about the impact of humans on the environment.",There is not yet any facility that brings together current and historic environmental data from different sources and allows searching and visualizing them in an intuitive way.,"Habitat will bundle content aggregators and Drupal modules into an easy-to-use, customizable, open-source dashboard that will also be attractive for other subject-oriented portals. As a partnership between a world-class research university and a technology museum, we understand the challenges of curating content not only to provide access, but to encourage participation. The Environment & Society Portal already taps a network of scholars from 40 countries and a dozen disciplines, able to produces high standard qualitative data. By providing the tools needed for sharing, curating and visualizing data produced by others, Habitat will create a dynamic and innovative space for data curation and analysis.","Habitat will be developed by the Environment & Society Portal team at the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society (RCC), a joint initiative of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Deutsches Museum. The RCC is the largest center for advanced studies worldwide in a fast-growing field of research, environmental humanities. A collaboration with the Network in Canadian History & Environment (NiCHE) and other international partners, the Habitat project brings together international expertise in both environmental studies and digital humanities.","The beta version of the Environment & Society Portal launched in early 2012 and is the first subject portal to make multimedia and interpretive environmental humanities content freely and openly accessible to academics, journalists, and an interested public. Its custom-designed interactive navigation tools (map viewer, timeline, and keyword explorer) encourage not only exploration and discovery, but also visualization of chronological, spatial, and conceptual connections. We are also developing the tools needed to facilitate the creation of content by users and partner institutions, propelling our international community of interest into highly visible and interactive engagement.","The funds will be used primarily to pay for the development of the Habitat platform, as regards both the design of a tool that will facilitate the editors’ work and increase the amount of available data by comparing different data sources for accuracy and the implementation of further web curation features.","During the funding period, we would establish an advisory board for data interoperability, mobilizing academic and non-profit societies to take on responsibility for the long-term curation of the Habitat platform. The RCC, its parent institutions, and partners such as the Bavarian State Library will continue hosting, technical maintenance, and long-term archiving for the project."

We’ve solved this problem.","This solution will succeed because it directly addresses the fundamental problem of access to data. This center’s mission will be to advance and communicate knowledge on social-media data. Using a close collaboration with Boulder-based Gnip.com, one of two exclusive Twitter data firehose licensees, which has direct firehose access and a single API to work across multiple social data sources, this Center will offer affordable means to encourage researchers and journalists to apply rich social-media data analysis to research projects and specific assignments.

Liu, Ph.D. USGS Mendenhall Research Fellow, social-media researcher and former researcher at Project Epic. University of Colorado’s Project Epic, a $2.8 million NSF-funded grant, helped set the impetus for this proposal. Project Epic worked closely with Gnip in accessing the Twitter firehose.","Beyond researching the available options for accessing social-media data firehoses, we have been working on establishing the conceptual and process components for the project. Other components that have taken shape are identifying the necessary steps at the University level for establishing a national center. In other words, we came up with the concept, identified the problem affecting journalists and media researchers, thought hard, and asked many people a lot of questions and researched how we could make this proposed Center a reality.","The funds will purchase Data Processing Hour Units (DPUs). Then researchers and journalists can apply for a nano-grant of DPUs for their project.  We will staff the Center with Fellows and Director who would help review, curate, research, and offer consulting to those researchers and journalists applying for the nano-grants.","One of the key goals of the Center is setting up relationships with interested individuals, foundations, other academic institutions, and media organizations. We believe some of these relationships will help establish an endowment so that this Center will continue to be a valuable resource after this round of funding expires."

It will live on the basis of the value, quality, and relevance of the information that users get. Our portal will truly be a semantic network.","In our semantic network: ·          Content architects (professionals with expertise in semantic network development) work with Subject Matter Experts (medical professionals with expertise in celiac disease) and celiac patients to capture the true ideas, emotions, symptoms, and knowledge. It will all be “codified” in the portal. ·          The initial period provides for the system to have the “seed” data from the Internet and from a select group of patients/SMEs. ·          New data added by users and found on the Internet will be continuously organized, to a great extent automatically. The actions of Internet users and SMEs will help in better organization of data.","Ictect, Inc. – the Intelligent Content Company (www.ictect.com), with its Content Architects, is working on this project.

We are also affiliated with researchers at University of Wisconsin system, and linguistic experts at IHMC Florida.","We’ve been brainstorming possibilities, ideas and developing prototypes. Prior to this, Ictect has spent several years in research and development of a unique methodology for organizing and structuring content. Ictect obtained a patent for this work (Method and System for Automated Structuring of Textual Documents – US Patent #7,251,777). Ictect has developed a number of smaller scale portals.",We will use the funds for following: ·          Contract with additional Subject Matter Experts ·          Hire additional Content Architects ·          Involve additional patients in the project ·          Portal Development,"We believe that patients will pay for accessing relevant, useful information.

With no information regarding water quality currently available, parents in impoverished regions consider water a health risk—meaning they shun interacting with water. Showing local water information through SMS or the mobile app would encourage hand washing on safe days and boiling on danger days.","Organizations like NextDrop and Flow share hyperlocal information regarding location of working water taps. We will collaborate to create a network platform compatible with existing databases, and include water safety data. ","Just as Yelp found success by empowering customers as food reporters and offering information provided by both peers and experts, mWater’s social network offers empowerment to report on a topic in which most of the world is highly invested. We are a team of experts in behavioral health, science and technology and we believe passionately in collaborating across traditional barriers to achieve health outcomes. Worldwide, women spend hours each day collecting water. Now, with their mobile, they will have an information source to assist this process. With daily knowledge about water quality, these women become active participants in the system-level effort to prevent waterborne disease. ","This is an open source effort that began at a 2011 hackathon. The project is co-founded by an environmental engineer who monitored NASA’s International Space Station water systems and a behavioral health scientist who develops mobile apps for reducing inequalities in health. The founders are guided by collaborators at UN Habitat and IHub in Nairobi. Additionally, the Montreal hacking community continues to be dedicated to and involved in the development of this technology. ","The ability to create a social network for water quality data depended on first developing a mobile app that reads inexpensive contamination tests and automated sensors that read in-line turbidity. Results from both upload to the cloud for remote mapping and monitoring. This stage is undergoing a UNHabitat-funded demonstration project in Tanzania. In the effort to disseminate this technology, we found many projects similar to our database, but incompatible with each other. mWater is the only provider of water quality data and, by collaborating with providers of other water data, we can host and maintain a global social network for disseminating water information.","We have done as much as we can with free hackers. At this point we need to pay developers, host the server and expand the demonstration project beyond Mwanza, Tanzania. We also need to hire a consultant to guide the social network’s financial sustainability through monitizing the app and website.","We plan to sell a pro membership to research institutions and governments conducting epidemiological monitoring. Additionally, we will sell ad space on the app. The Sub-Saharan and rural Indian mobile markets are difficult for corporations to reach and, as a result, the demand for targeted ads is growing quickly. "

One Voice enables civic engagement through leadership development, training, and technical assistance to improve the quality of life of disenfranchised communities. WWNO is the NPR affiliate for the 1,600,000 residents of New Orleans, Houma-Thibodaux, and southeast Louisiana, broadcasting on 89.9 FM, and KTLN 90.5 FM. ","Based on significant community demand for data on poverty, we have developed a prototype “data profile” focused on poverty that examines stereotypes about Southeast Louisiana’s impoverished population. It quantifies the extent to which the poor are working, the number that are elderly and disabled, and where they live in the 13-parish region (predominantly and increasingly in the suburbs).  And we have created highly usable, interactive visualizations that display poverty rates of subgroups (children, elderly, disabled, etc.) for any combination of the 13 parishes. We have not yet incorporated community voice into this profile.","Funds will support GNOCDC Chief Demographer’s analysis of data and GIS Specialist’s development of data visualizations, as well as WWNO’s production of “demographic road trips.” One Voice would use funds to support the engagement of communities on the ground to lift up the impacts of population change.","GNOCDC is working with the Greater New Orleans Foundation to develop a cadre of local donors to sustain our foundational demographic research.

Still there is embarrassing little publicly available infrastructure in place to process and distribute that data. Forcing everyone to start from scratch while paying the needed infrastructure out of their own pocket.,The project is based on the premise that providing a publicly available Open Infrastructure is key to further growth in Open Source Software and enhancing the usability of Open Data.,Because there is very little voodoo involved and the approach is already used by dozens of non publicly available supercomputers. Using cheap off the shelf hardware and Open Source Software to build a distributed storage and data processing system is a more complex endeavor then e.g. using a commercial cloud service. But it leads to huge cost savings once you scale the system into dozens of CPUs and hundreds terabytes of data.

We’ll help users do their job more thoroughly, while creating a structure that can be re-used later.","Network analysis means many things to people: it’s graph algorithms to coders, network diagrams to designers and CRM to business. Journalists and advocates need evidence gathering and information linkage to be at the core of these things.","We want to focus on four functions that will make this a practical tool instead of a gimmick: a) allowing users to easily integrate bulk data to complement manually entered information, b) helping them to keep track of the source for each fact that is entered and keeping a full version history, c) providing easy access control so that users can choose which information to keep private and which links to publish with others and d) text snippets, so that researchers can combine structured analysis and narrative fragments in which the tool will detect references to the network’s entities.","The Open Knowledge Foundation wants to cooperate with investigative networks around the world to develop this project. We’ve already been pioneering data collection and presentation tools, such as DataHub.io and OpenSpending, as well as efforts like the Data Journalism Handbook and the School of Data to widen data literacy. Friedrich Lindenberg (OKFN) has worked on several data projects and data-journalism training and will lead this project. Ross Jones (OKFN) will contribute as a software architect. Stefan Candea (2011 Nieman Fellow at Harvard, Director of the Romanian Center for Investigative Journalism) has offered to advise us.","We’ve already built Grano, a REST backend that can store network information, generate custom reports about nodes and relations and run full-text search. Because we think that meaningful network analysis is hard, we are conservative in the choice of technology to focus on outcomes. To force that, we decided to base our tool on a concrete use case. The software is now first used in an unannounced project that tracks lobbying in the EU, powering a special-purpose, JavaScript-only site. Unfortunately, this means the current prototype does not have a stand-alone web interface and the serious data integration capabilities we think it needs.","We want to develop Grano to give investigative journalists and civic hackers a (re-usable) web interface to design their network structure, manually enter data, integrate bulk data sets and to explore the resulting network, make notes, calculate key metrics and to export reports, rankings and network visualizations.","While the service is going to be of immediate use, we believe that advocacy groups and newsrooms will also deploy it as a backend to their features and campaign sites.

The interface in development enables users to create bar graphs, pie charts and choropleth maps of 2010 census data.","The money will fund a position for a Programmer Analyst, one graduate and one undergraduate student to finish work on the interface design and development, purchase software licenses and if necessary expand the Statewide Database’s IT infrastructure to ensure that the interface is robust and functions seamlessly.",The current funding and staffing of the Statewide Database is sufficient for the maintenance of the interface after the development phase. We estimate that the main cost will be the design and development of the interface. Maintenance of the interface once established will be nominal.
MobileScope,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25571949791/mobilescope,,Provide complete transparency into the information mobile smartphones and website applications collect and share about their users.,"Our goal is to uncover the typically-hidden data flows arising from the web and mobile smartphone applications in use today.  We intend to provide transparency and reputation so that users, press, and regulators can make better decisions about the Internet app ecosystem.  This is a follow on to our work for the WSJ’s App Transparency project in 2010.","We are the only ones that can provide one-click installation on most popular smartphones, including iPhone and Android without requiring users to perform complicated steps such as ‘rooting’ their devices.   Additionally, we have built large-scale Internet privacy measurement platforms that scale. We would continue to develop a platform that provides this data to anyone/everyone interested.","Mobile environments are typically closed platforms produced under strictly enforced agreements between handset makers, network operators, and software platforms such as Google and iPhone.  These platforms have very little incentive to provide transparency and control as their primary source of revenue from the mobile space is through the sale of advertisements and the sale of apps, both of which rely on the collection of consumer data. Our system will leverage expertise in mobile security, internet privacy, and information visualization in order to present usable insights and controls for mobile smartphone users. We’ve already built out the core pieces of this technology and have proved its usefulness by assisting in multiple mobile transparency projects in the press.  Now we want the opportunity to scale it to a broader audience and make the data accessible to anyone.","David Campbell principal at Electric Alchemy (a boutique mobile security company) and one of the key researchers behind the WSJ’s ‘Your Apps Are Watching You’ dataset monitoring the transmission of private information by smartphones.

We could either sell enterprise access to the data or provide application testing and certification in order to fund ongoing costs for the project."

This app helps you to automatically select the best pictures of several sets and share them with your friends or business partners.","This app is the first to sequence pictures from different cameras and cameraphones, which helps you to choose the best image of a particular moment and share your best subset.","Every month more than 31 billion pictures are taken of which some 6 billion are shared online. Selecting a high-quality subset for sharing can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience, especially when the same event was captured by several cameras. This app puts pictures from different cameras in chronological order. Next, blurry and fuzzy pictures are automatically sorted out. Then, the app proposes a stochastic subset of photos based on the actual number of pictures taken per time interval. If you don’t like a particular image, the app lets you replace pictures by showing you related photos taken at the same time. Finally you can share the selection with your friends.","The esprITschmiede (www.espritschmiede.de) is run by a team of highly committed and talented young professionals with much experience in the implementation of IT and electronic related projects.

Tobias Lechtenfeld is specialised in applied economics and will support the project in all questions connected to the creation and implementation of a vision, business plan, marketing issues and sustainability.","Seeing the need for such a product, we started with market research. A small customer survey showed demand for solving the problem of the tons of pictures we take at every event. We then developed a prototype for putting pictures from different cameras in chronological order, which is central for finding subsets. We also started identifying algorithms to automatically flag blurry and fuzzy pictures.","The funds would be used for finalizing the software algorithm, building an intuitive user interface, and putting it all together in an android/iphone app. We also need to kick-start a small marketing campaign to get out on the market.","The project has low running cost which can already be sustained from few sales.

The public is presented with a few graphs, but not the hundreds of datasets from which they were derived. By providing visual representations of the best available data and clear explanations of underlying scientific methodology, viewers can educate themselves about the climatological record.","Most climate data repositories are either accurate but geared towards scientists, or are designed to advance a specific ideology. I’ll use peer-reviewed data, and present it for public consumption.","The history of Earth’s climate is of great interest to many people, and most have a genuine desire to understand how scientists can determine global temperatures from past millennia. They have difficulty finding lucid explanations of the processes that scientists use, and difficulty finding and interpreting the collected data.  The data behind the climate record, however, is geospatial in nature, which lends itself to an intuitive visual representation. I believe that informative visualizations of the raw data will increase public knowledge about the state of climatology, including the strengths, weaknesses, and the legitimate scientific debates of the climate record.","I have spent 11 years working with scientists to create visualizations for public outreach. My credits include the IMAX film “Hubble 3D”, PBS NOVA shows including “Hunt for the Supertwister” and “Monster of the Milky Way”, as well as several museum and digital planetarium exhibits, including the upcoming exploration of Earth’s climate system “Dynamic Earth.” My expertise is in working closely with scientists, immersing myself in their data, then developing software tools to visualize their data accurately and compellingly. I have worked with atmospheric scientists, oceanographers, and climatologists to help both them and the public to better understand their data.","In an effort to visualize the historical effects of climate variables on forest fire, I have begun collaboration with climate researchers at the University of Arizona This has required developing techniques for the coherent visualization of datasets gathered from dozens of researchers. I have created some basic interactive tools for exploration of the data, however, these need to be made web-accessible for this project. I would also need to work with more researchers to incorporate their findings into the visualizations.","Funds would be used to: - Cover the salary of the principal investigator, - Hire an experienced web developer, - Purchase hardware required for development, - Cover the cost of hosting the project website, - Cover travel to meet with climate scientists at NOAA, NCAR, and other research institutions.","Federal funding agencies now demand that publicly funded science be made intelligible and accessible to the taxpayer. When the current project is established, it will be a very attractive mechanism that climate scientists across the country can include on federal grants to satisfy their public outreach requirements."

It will create recommendations for the user on the basis of the data of users with similar commenting, liking and sharing activities so that the more time one spends using this browser, the more relevant contents it will recommend. Moreover, the browser will recommend not only contents, but also groups which one can join on the basis of one’s established user interests. It can be said that the speciality of the browser is its capacity to analyse comments and likes through a mathematical model and software called the sixstep, which we have successfully tested. (http://www.sixstep.hu)","One can choose from quite a few recommendation pages today, but none of them relies on social media activities. Our solution implements a world of internet browsing, which is only a dream today: to reach all that one is interested in and to avoid all that one is not interested in.","The foundation of our system is that it is based on the personality and the interests of the user, and its aim is to understand and promote the activities of the user more and more. The more users join the system and the more of them use this browser, the more appropriate and relevant the material will be that the system can recommend for those using the system.

Example: we have tracked attitudes toward President Obama and Republican presidential candidates over time, from different news sources (e.g., Fox News vs. MSNBC), and their relation to world events and metrics like approval ratings. Academic papers on the method are currently in review. For updates, see http://journostats.com. Funding for this project will be used to refine the algorithms; automate continued collection of large-scale databases; and create web-based tools that make the methods easily accessible to non-specialists.","The Journostats is project is headed by Dr. Jon Willits of Indiana University, an expert in analyzing language statistics and applying them to real-world data. Jon Willits has over 10 years of experience analyzing large datasets, specializing in statistical analyses of natural language. Journostats also employs Dr. Mark Seidenberg of the University of Wisconsin. Mark Seidenberg is a world expert in computational models of language.","We have already developed the algorithms that analyze media coverage in terms of various topics’ frequency, positivity of coverage, similarity of coverage to other topics, and co-occurrences and correlations of coverage with various other topics. We have also developed a number of methods for comparing these analyses to other real-world information and events, such as public opinion polls, election outcomes, current events, and behavioral reactions to coverage. We have also developed basic prototypes of what we would like the web-based graphical interface to look like.","Automate the collection, storage, and indexing of journalism, news, and media coverage, from blogs and websites to transcripts of television and radio news Refine algorithms correlating media analyses with public opinion data and real-world events Implement web-based graphical interface for interacting with data Market the website","One of the primary goals of the project is to make the process as automatic as possible. Beyond the initial stages of implementing the interface and data-gathering algorithms, the project is self-sustaining. Minor costs such as web hosting are easily coverable by small donations from project members and project supporters."

We intend to tell people where they should go to find jobs and what they can expect to find there.",The existing data networks only offer profiles of job seekers and job offers. We want to use our journalistic skills to help the growing number of unemployed analyze information and display it in a way that helps them find a job abroad.,"1) We have years of experience making complex business content user friendly. 2) There is a huge demand for this type of service. The economic crisis affecting many countries has left millions of professionals unemployed and with little or no hope of finding work in their own countries. Finding jobs abroad is their only option. 3) We will provide data on the fastest-growing sectors in selected countries, the companies with the greatest number of foreign employees, a list of professional skills in demand and how to obtain a work permit.","Marga Zambrana, founder, journalist.

Connecting Citizens in Electoral Campaigns,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25571907401/connecting-citizens-in-electoral-campaigns,850,I propose building a voting advice application for the European Parliamentary Elections 2014 allowing users to match with each other.,"The data generated by this project enables like-minded citizens to connect and jointly act. Users of voting advice applications provide enormous amounts of data. With this project, however, it will for the first time be possible for users to match with political parties, civil society groups and other individual users.","This project builds on earlier experiences with voting advice applications. It innovates, as users will not only match with the political offer (parties, candidates), but the demands by fellow citizens.","In recent national elections voting advice applications have been used by over 15 percent of the electorate within a few campaign weeks. These tools attract users because they simplify the complex, multi-dimensional stances of political parties and candidates. The tailor-made information on users’ positions in the political landscape is enormously appreciated. This project now goes further: users can match with like-minded users across all of Europe. Through social-media-linked applications they can invite their peers into their own political group. This will work because it is simple, intuitive and because it fills a void left by traditional parties.","Prof. Alexander H. Trechsel from the European University Institute was the project leader of the euprofiler.eu voting advice application. For the new project, the EUI, with Prof. Trechsel, will be working with a team of data specialists under the coordination of Prof. R. Michael Alvarez (California Institute of Technology). We will be either using our former tech partners in the Netherlands and in Switzerland or propose a new technological collaboration to programmers. The team at the EUI will be responsible for the party positional codings and the translations of the application into all EU languages.","The conceptualization and practical implementation of the basic tool (the Voting Advice Application) is, to a great extent built already and at the disposal of this project. The team at the European University Institute is constituted and ready to proceed with the coding of parties’ positions. Also, the technological infrastructure for interacting with the political parties running in the elections is set up and ready to be used. Finally, we have gathered extensive experience in dealing with the individual level data generated by the 2009 Euprofiler project, that attracted 2.5 million users in only six weeks.","The News Challenge funds would enable us to complete the data infrastructure, to make the tool public and to innovate in the data analyses from large-n group dynamics across an entire continent. It would allow for careful and thorough evaluation of these tools utility for voters and the public.","The data gathered by this project would remain dynamic and continue to produce further connections between citizens. This possibly largest public opinion measurement tool would continue attracting scholars analyzing group formation, political mobilization and partisan adaptation. It could be easily implemented in the US Presidential or Congressional elections of 2016."

Our project will link these data to make them more accessible to neurosurgeons, making possible a faster preparation of the intervention, to infer possible sequels of a surgery and to suggest new surgical approaches.","CurrentNeuronavigation systems rely just on anatomical information. But Brain is more than anatomy: Function, Connectivity, and Diseases… Our aim is to present all this information, properly linked.","This new Neuronavigation system is based in a Knowledge Management System that links many databases. We aim at building a Knowledge Graph about Neuroscience. This Knowledge Graph is analogous to the Semantic Web concept of Ontology. The advantage of using Graphs is that there are well-known and efficient databases that allow traversing the Graph and obtaining new Knowledge. This project will work because it relies on technologies considered state-of-the-art in their respective fields (NoSQL databases, complex information visualization techniques…) which will be applied in a new context, Neurosurgery, to provide more comprehensive information to the specialist.","Currently, several companies are selling their Neuronavigation systems. However,  those systems suffer from a lack of useful information. They all are focused in and only take into account the anatomical information about Brain. This is, by far, the information most well-known by neurosurgeons. Our proposal aims at include in this kind of systems all available information about Human Brain which can be important at a surgical intervention, e.g., connectivity, functionality… Using techniques like augmented and virtual reality, out intention is to provide a completely new user experience for neurosurgeons.","In this moment, we are in the middle of the development of a Knowledge Management System which 1. Integrates information from different databases related to Brain; 2. Infers new Knowledge by the use of a Reasoning Engine able to extract patterns and similarities in data. The parts of the project that remain unfinished are: Complete the Knowledge Management System with the Knowledge Graph, introduce Neuroimaging Techniques to obtain real data from patients, augmented and virtual reality systems for visualizing information, a surgical planner with prediction of surgical outcome.","We need different profiles in order to develop the system. First, two programmers, at least one with experience in Neuroimage, to develop all the system back-end. The graphical user interface has to be done by a designer, and the commercialization of the system will require a professional marketer.","The proposed system would be sold at much lower price than the competitors, taking into account the smaller costs with respect a big company. We foresee a good market penetration of the system, and thus the project and its subsequent updates will be self-sustainable."

Besides logistics companies invest in information systems that result in further automating their warehouses and automate the ordering process and purchases from suppliers.,"It has a powerful search engine in various data sources to establish dataminig processes, various connectors for synchronization with other clinical organizations of different sizes and a static system of rules for making decisions regarding the parameters of alert thresholds and correlation among other input parameters.","For procurement of:- An analyst, a programmer analyst and programmer with expertise in neural networks and intelligent systems.- A consultant pharmacist for marketing products and byproducts.- An expert in communication for dissemination of results and objectives of the project.- Assessment of research groups for knowledge transfer",One of the greatest benefits of the system that will allow significant cost savings in drug costs so that we believe can have a great insight into the great public health systems or private.

This data must be processed, compiled and verified within a very short timespan before being incorporated into a news story. Semantic Web technologies can enhance this process by linking data from various sources and providing context and evidence to news materials gathered through social media.","There has been some work in related areas: citizen reporting tools; manual curation of crowdsourced news; semantic technologies for storage and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, no project has yet taken advantage of Semantic Web technologies for crowdsourced contextualised news production. ","The unstructured data generated by citizens lies scattered across the Social Web but can be formalised and linked to other semantically-enriched datasets in what is termed the “Linked Data Cloud” for integration, verification and fact-checking purposes, e.g. government datasets or DBpedia/Wikipedia. A significant part of the project will be around evangelising this solution for trustworthy news creation across various broadcast mechanisms. The underlying technologies will be very much in the background; all the journalist will see is a practical and useful tool for breaking news production.

QNA’s coding scheme is based on invariant properties of narrative: its sequential organization in story and plot and, linguistically, its context-free structure based on a subject-verb-object grammar. (2) Because QNA has been tested in the collection and analysis of news data for over twenty years (with several books and journal articles published on the topic), and several researchers across the globe have based their projects on this methodology. (3) Because we start from a well-developed, well-tested software prototype that implements the core functions of QNA (www.pc-ace.com). (4) Because two scholars with complementary expertise (sociology/linguistics and computer science) back the project.","Prof. Roberto Franzosi (Emory University, Department of Sociology, Program in Linguistics). Defined the QNA methodology, wrote extensively about its application to socio-historical research, developed a first prototype of the QNA infrastructure, experimented extensively with this prototype on large news analysis projects studying collective violence (e.g. lynchings in Georgia, fascism in Italy).  Dr. Fabio Cunial (PhD in computer science, GeorgiaTech). Worked on the development of Franzosi’s QNA prototype since 2006, has a strong background in the design, analysis and tuning of algorithms, in machine learning, data mining, and computational biology.","A fully working and usable prototype of the core functions, with no automatic parsing, no statistically rigorous data analysis, and no scalability to massive datasets. This software has been tested in middle-size research projects with few hundreds of thousands newspaper articles and few million events, and has very elementary ways of interacting with third-party network visualization tools, sequence analysis tools, and statistical packages. The prototype has been originally developed by non-expert programmers on the Microsoft Access platform: this technology limits its performance, and complicates distribution, code maintenance, debugging, and distributed data entry.",To hire high-performance software developers and algorithm engineers to design and build the core of the software package.,With other grants and donations: this software is and will always be free and open source.

The reality is that monitoring is sparse, data collected is locked down and published information is averaged to the point of uselessness. Safecast data is specific, granular and published free of licensing restrictions.","Current data is provided in city wide averages, if it’s provided at all. We are working to build a specific and granular dataset allowing people to see street level variations.","The Safecast team mobilized existing networks and hackerspaces, and used open philosophies to create the most reliable and detailed global radiation measurement database available. Generating over 3 million datapoints in less than 12 months. We will apply the same theory and sensibilities to air quality, but unlike radiation our efforts won’t be tied to an event (and fleeting news coverage) in a single country as air quality is already an issue of ongoing global concern. That over 22,000 people follow a twitter account reporting hourly air quality reports in Beijing suggests this is an issue that people already care about.","The Safecast team currently includes hackers, scientists, researchers, engineers, programmers, makers, students, translators and designers. Our core team of around 30 people led by Sean Bonner (global operations), Pieter Franken (Japan), bunnie Huang (hardware), Paul Campbell (data) and Anthony DeVincenzi (visualizations) is supplemented by advisors Joi Ito, Ian McFarland, Jun Murai, Ray Ozzie, and Dan Sythe as well as over 100 regular volunteers and the combined resources of hackerspaces in Tokyo and Los Angeles. Additionally all software and hardware used and developed is open source allowing the efforts of a much larger community to compliment, support and maintain our efforts.",Since March 2011 our primary focus has been collecting radiation readings in Japan and those efforts have been very successful. We’ve developed open source hardware specifically for this task including a recently successful Kickstarter initiative to aid in commercially manufacturing a new geiger counter that was 2600% overfunded. We’ve build a robust database structure to support this complete with APIs to easily allow interaction with the data and as well as a visualization platform to display this data that we call GeoSense. We have just begun measuring radiation outside of Japan and are researching best approaches for air quality monitoring.,"We’ll spend funds on development and production of hardware, next stage development of software and online infrastructures including web and mobile apps enabling people to interact with and understand the data as well as travel and salaries to enable our global staff to spend dedicated time to achieve these goals.","Safecast is a non-profit that currently relies on grants, donations and community support, however a largely volunteer team and use of open source at every step ensures the project can live on sans funding. Additionally we’re working on official licensing deals for our hardware designs that will ensure ongoing contributions."

Conversely, this would give content creators secondary opportunities for their works that may have been bypassed due to geography or other roadblocks.","Unlike other audio aggregators, Talkpical allows listeners to grab specific discussions they want to hear without downloading whole programs. Plus, they can format similar ideas into the newscast they want.","Currently, there are thousands of news stories, press conferences, government hearings and other event based audio produced every hour. However, studies have shown that the time to search and listen to anything has fallen like the Euro. The impediment isn’t lack of content or availability, it’s specificity. Or the ability to get to the specific topics they want in the concise terms they need. Talkpical offers listeners the opportunity to mix, format and download the newscast they want for the time they have.Also, Talkpical offers content creators repurposing opportunities for works previously produced for all mediums.","An eclectic career producing entertaining and thought-provoking talk radio programs, Keith Williams has had stops at all forms of talk radio. He developed and produced one of the first radio programs in a major market that centered on video gaming - “Gamer!”. Today, his independent public radio program - “The Pundit Class” - is where he has put his skills to the test and discovered his true love of the audio form. Also, he has studied Web Development at Glendale College.","The best example and spirit of Talkpical runs within the independent public radio program - “The Pundit Class”.

Talkpical is “The Pundit Class” writ large and more autonomous for listeners.","First, expand the team to include programmers and content curators. Then, obtain distribution licenses from producers if necessary. Next, build and test prototypes.

Currently we’ve suffered with sub-par ways of filling gaps; including trading files on USB sticks and waiting days until Internet was available.,"The funds would be utilized to create the initial system with 3 nodes located in North America, Europe, and Asia. Funds will be used for: Engineering to design and configure system Documenting the process to set-up a node Testing to tune the system Hardware deployment and maintenance  Outreach to gain donated nodes",The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team already sustains itself through a combination of project funding and a large volunteer base. By investing time in documentation and outreach the distributed system will have distributed support; additional nodes will find homes in universities and regional OpenStreetMap groups.  Becoming core to OpenStreetMap will ensure sustainability.
Digital NewsRoom of Cultural Impact and Innovation,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25571866999/digital-newsroom-of-cultural-impact-and-innovation,500000,We propose to build a Digital Newsroom of stories and data regarding black culture’s economic impact to science and technology.,"We will connect and archive multiple sources of data to visualize trends overlayed with archival and current stories to be published as RSS feeds, via a Wiki, and in an interactive social media timeline. Our hope is to connect a community, advocate, spark innovation, and dispel stereotypes.",No such comprehensive connected data chart exists or published digital archive for reuse. Connecting the data together reveals interesting statistical trends and connects a disparate community with a powerful resource.,"We have already created working pilots of open source monthly RSS Feeds, built working timelines, identified sources, and piece-meal existing statistical public trends from birth to professional careers identifying gaps and inconsistencies.  We have received overwhelming encouragement to continue and requests to partner on this venture.  We are also linking sustainable revenue generating resources to this project.  The project has provided an opportunity to engage youth from underserved areas to learn about digital media, publishing, science writing, and how to become innovators.  We have been able to build cross-continental and cross-institutional partners to contribute to this meta-data, multi-media project.","The Robert R. Taylor Network, Inc. is the primary author in collaboration with corporate, non-profit  and university partners. High school and college students are engaged in technology and content development through a summer and academic year academy.  Professionals are mentors and guides to the youth as well as engaged in providing services to the implementation of the vision. Professional journalists, writers, and researchers are involved in writing stories, researching facts, and documenting history. IBM, Brainshark, MIT, Hampton University, NIHERST, Caribbean Axis, and Career Communications Group are some of our partners.","We have built an opensource platform, timeline, and wiki using WordPress and IBM technologies at www.adias.org.  We have also piloted a community network site at www.rrtn.net to connect a distributed network of node sites around the world which may have no access to powerful computing resources.  This includes building a pilot opensource server box with opensource laptops to distribute to high schools and colleges that wish to be a part of the project.  We also created an initial e-mall using Amazon.  We publish monthly and quarterly newsfeeds using Constant Contact.  And we have produced an extensible multimedia travelling exhibit.","News Challenge Funds would be used to acquire needed technology and services, compensate students and professionals, such as journalists, researchers, and writers, travel to original sources, convene an international community of stakeholders, hold workshops and conferences, buy rights, digitize content, pay technology license fees, and attract additional sponsors.","We plan to create a Consortium, develop revenue-generating businesses based on subscription, advertising, e-mall, travel, and consulting services not only for the organization but for the individuals connected to the project."

The querying system will allow local journalists, bloggers, and the public to find information and visualize data based on geography, relevance, or time, and to contact researchers in subjects of interest.","Academics and journalists are often limited in their approaches to sharing and obtaining information. We will bridge the gaps among academia, media, and the public using a compelling new format.","Work toward open local information access is ongoing. A unified, accessible system will allow users to share, extract and visualize relevant information, crowdsourcing data-driven decision making on a local scale. With numerous citizen, government, business, nonprofit, academic, and civic partnerships in place, we are uniquely positioned to provide a real-time, shared academic-civic space, aligning common efforts and generating knowledge and idea exchange.  VCU has built trust through a history of work in the community, and a strategic mandate to target excellence in teaching, research, and substantive civic engagement.  VCU also has several major data centered projects to leverage for impact.","Faculty from Public Affairs, Mass Communications, Computer Science, Business, the Medical School, and the President’s Office are working to make VCU data and analysis expertise useful to the community.  Partners include the VCU Libraries, VCU School of Social Work, Richmond Times-Dispatch, two major local foundations, Richmond Public Library, and the Bridging Richmond project, which aims to impact student success through collaborative partnerships. Partners will have much to share in terms of analysis and data, and communities will benefit from greater access to reliable information that can engage the public, foster civic engagement and be used in policy and decision-making.","The VCU Center for Clinical and Translational Research (CCTR) provides infrastructure, expertise and translation to make interdisciplinary human health research usable. CCTR engages and supports collaborative participation among researchers, students, government, community partners, and volunteers in the Richmond region to generate innovative research that transforms the scientific study of human health.

Air Quality Egg,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25571865519/air-quality-egg,150000,"Air Quality Egg is a collaborative, open sensor network for air quality data.","Air Quality Egg is pioneering a new way to understand air quality via huge numbers of high-resolution, uncalibrated data streams.  While these sensor networks will be common in the future, the methods of making sense of these types of datasets are currently unknown.","Current air quality monitoring initiatives are too expensive, sparse, or inaccessible to concerned citizens. Air Quality Egg puts inexpensive tools to measure air quality in the hands of the individual.","We believe that, more important than the promise of “it will work”, collecting and understanding data is a continual conversation of calibration, development, and redesign. The focus of Air Quality Egg is to foster and build an open collaborative community that monitors, addresses, and engages in pertinent air quality issues. Designers, scientists, and citizens collaborate through open forums like the Air Quality Egg Google Group, an online wiki, and Github to develop hardware, mapping applications, and deployment strategies. We hope to leverage the potentials of cheap sensors and networks in bringing awareness and action to invisible aspects of everyday environments.","This is a large, international, open source community. Specific project collaborators include Ed Borden, Joe Saavedra, Wicked Device, Albert Chao, Leif Percifield, Eulani Labay, Casper Koomen, Axel Roest, Dorien Zandbergen, other individuals from the Sensemakers  community, as well as assistance from Cosm/LogMeIn. Meetups and workshops have also been held in Amsterdam and New York City. In addition, other scientists, engineers, developers, and designers have contributed to the conversation through the Air Quality Egg Google Group.","We have built initial hardware prototypes for measuring air quality with some live data feeds that can be found on Cosm (formerly Pachube). We also have iterated through several enclosure designs. We recently were funded through Kickstarter to develop the Air Quality Egg kits. By fall of 2012, we will have distributed over 1,100 sensor units internationally. Again, individuals have lent particular expertise in the development of the hardware and enclosure of the device. Anyone can follow and contribute to the conversation through the Air Quality Egg Google Group.","The support from News Challenge funds would go toward Air Quality Eggs that will be given to science departments of public schools. Our goal is to achieve a high density of Eggs in New York City, distribute sensors evenly, and engage children in open source technology.","Research, design, and discussions from scientists, engineers, makers, and other interested individuals are very active in the Air Quality Egg Google Group. We will continue to build an open collaborative repository for the development of the device and its use in different environments, scenarios, and other unforeseen applications."
Wikichains: Encouraging Ethical Consumption through Open and Transparent Data,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25571863693/wikichains-encouraging-ethical-consumption-through,15000,Build a user-generated platform that allows people to better understand the histories and geographies of the things that they buy.,We will employ Semantic Mediawiki technology and multi-platform mobile apps to build an open and free wiki allowing people to share information about any aspect of any commodity chain of any product. It will allow people to make more informed ethical and political decisions about how they spend their money. ,"Similar ideas exist, but none use user-generated content to bring about transparency in commodity chains. By placing user-generated content in a structured semantic platform, we can move beyond their limitations.","It will work because most of us have an unsatisfied hunger for information about the things that we buy. We rarely know much about the ethical, environmental, political, and social implications buying cups of coffee or pairs of shoes.  Our work satisfies this need by encouraging people from around the world to upload text, images, sounds, and videos of any node on any commodity chain. A semantic Mediawiki platform will then allow structured information to be presented to users in article form and interactive commodity chain maps linking sites of production and consumption (available on desktop and mobile devices).","The project is led by Dr. Mark Graham at the Oxford Internet Institute. The Oxford Internet Institute is a leading international research and policy institute based at the University of Oxford. We focus on understanding the social implications of the Internet and communicating them to public and policy audiences. Mark Graham frequently writes about the Internet and society in the media (e.g. in the Guardian, The Atlantic) and directs a blog visited by hundreds of thousands of people. The platform will be developed and hosted by an experienced team of designers, database specialists, and academics at the Oxford Internet Institute.","We have already built a rough Semantic Mediawiki prototype that has allowed us to better design the underlying database structure and data ontologies. We therefore now have a detailed plan for the necessary structures and rules to link millions of observations and data points about commodity chains.  On a design level, the prototype has enabled us to establish an appropriate balance between structured information (e.g. locations, wages) and unstructured information (e.g. descriptions of  environmental harm) about commodities. It has also allowed us to create preliminary visualisations and maps automatically generated from the structured data that people upload to the system. ","We would use the funds to complete our prototype, develop mobile apps that allow people to use the data on the move (using barcode scanning and optical recognition), populate the platform with sample content, release the data for reuse, host the platform on dedicated servers, and promote the project.  ","The Oxford Internet Institute is committed to maintaining the project and offers a stable institutional home. Our key needs are the initial startup, design, and development costs. The institute offers permanent technical support and the permanent guidance of (faculty member) Mark Graham and many graduate students dedicated to this work. "
Rapid Data Journalism,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25571862762/rapid-data-journalism,,Put publically available data into the hands of citizens and journalists who do not have programming or technical skills.,"Open access does not equal public utility.  Our system will allow users to integrate and synthesize data of interest to them from disparate information sources (e.g., social networking sites, news organizations and government).  An interactive visual dashboard will enable users to select and visualize as well as publish the data.","Uncovering truth requires access to data.  Journalists cannot visualize or mash up data they do not have.  Our tool enables targeted collection, management and analysis of the data users want.","Our robust proof of concept data collection platform establishes that we can synthesize disparate data sources and sustain the collection of constantly generated data.  The pilot system enables users to collect and analyze data from many sources, including Twitter, Facebook, blogs and official government data sources. We are collecting data for a dozen research institutions and have published more than 30 peer-reviewed papers examining these data sets.  The next step is scaling our system up and making it available to a wider, non-academic audience.  This will increase understanding of information needs among journalists and citizens.","The team has a seven-year track record of gathering, integrating and synthesizing data from disparate sources.  We are an Assistant Professor, three doctoral candidates and two full time, undergraduate students.  Our system development and publication record spans the disciplines of data collection, integration and applied analysis in multiple domains: Civic engagement, online learning, software engineering, disaster response, recreational sports, political events and popular culture.","Two proof of concept projects are complete.  One is focused on integration of heterogeneous social media data.  The second is focused on the continuous collection and management of data from social media and public sources. These projects, together, have yielded a method, algorithms and a working code base that provides a solid foundation for the proposed project. For example, to date we have built and deployed three different Twitter Collection tools; TwitterZombie, TwitterHydra, TwigBrother.  We have also gathered Facebook data and integrated it with data from Twitter to develop a more comprehensive understanding of certain phenomena.","Funds will pay for software developers (methods, algorithms and public website), travel and deployment (cloud services).  People costs include tuition and stipend for three doctoral candidates, two full-time undergraduate COOP programmers and one month of Assistant Professor time.  Travel costs are for collaboration with news organizations and dissemination of results. ",The resulting system will be supported by Drexel University’s existing infrastructure for research computing for at least two years beyond the funding period of the grant.  Long-term sustainability will be pursued through the formation of a not for profit organization to support data in the public interest.

Longcost will enable buyers to “look” at different outcomes of a loan, micro credit or buying something on credit. Areas of application range from quick mobile answers to personalized side-by-side visualizations enabling users to compare.  ","Comparison sites often have a hidden bias, aiming to make a buy look good, as in “a car for just 99 Dollars”. Longcost instead will be a user/buyer tool only.","Longcost makes a difference by enabling people around the world to make their own visual picture of what is will cost them. The data will be kept strictly private, with options to put different deal types side by side to reveal patterns. This project is heavily influenced by the existing “Rent or buy calculator”, from the New York Times.

While video games are sometimes viewed as mindless forms of entertainment, they represent the cutting edge of technology and have recently been shown to improve a player’s speed, accuracy, vision, and multitasking capabilities. Further, these improved skills are not just within the game, but translate back into the real-world. Likewise, a tool that immerses a user in an interactive environment leveraging game engine technology will have greater capabilities than current solutions and likely make data more useful, accessible, and actionable.","Fragile Earth Studios is a project operated within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that leverages data visualizations, simulations, virtual worlds, and games to better understand real-world challenges. We collaborate with a variety of both internal and external partners creating engaging virtual content.  Our program has unique expertise straddling science, education, and entertainment and we are currently the only group within NOAA pursuing this kind of research.  We can create an innovative product that could change the way the public interacts with big data.","TerraViz is still early in development, but the results are promising. We have created demonstrations for Mac and Windows desktops as well as one that runs natively in a web browser. TerraViz needs a lot of polish and has a long way to go before a public release.

As the public becomes more aware, they can press civic leaders to motivate business owners to modify their practices. Everyone wins. Safe communities are great for business and residents.","As an individual, I am diligently working on this data-sharing tool business model as well as prototype websites that can be used to engage clients. I have yet to find examples of similar alcohol outlet licensing and enforcement reporting tools by any state or local municipality. I know of several communities throughout the world that are utilizing the place of last drink survey tool however, their number is minimal.

Digital tools will analyze documents to identify newsworthy city, county, and statewide trends. Visitor participation will improve the data by illustrating its broader community context. Data will be used to dramatically increase local news coverage.","No similar tool exists to aggregate large sets of town government records, which can then be leveraged to report a large volume of local news.","VPR’s Public Post has proven the journalistic value of indexing and analyzing Selectboard meeting minutes and dedicating reporters to this news beat (e.g. http://bit.ly/publicposteg). The expanded project is a strategic initiative of Vermont Public Radio to utilize data-journalism as a way to cover local and regional government across the entire state without having reporters in every town. Our partner, NearbyFYI, makes the data available, we’re working together to make it understandable, and Public Post makes it relevant for citizens as well as journalists.",VPR will lead development of this new application. VPR will also devote the necessary news staff and leverage the participation of our engaged audience. NearbyFYI will provide the data - the city and town records - via API access to its index of town government documents. VPR and NearbyFYI will work together to improve the index and develop crowd-sourced interaction and feedback loops to improve and to help give context and meaning to the data. The web application will be available as open source so others can continue to develop and re-use it in the future.,"NearbyFYI has developed a limited Beta version of its City Crawler, which indexes records from Vermont city and town websites and creates structured metadata for the documents. VPR has developed a working public prototype, Public Post, to aggregate, search, and analyze these documents for news stories. It also has integrated tools for public sharing and commenting. VPR has reported its findings through its many digital and broadcast platforms, including social media such as Twitter, news posts on VPR.net, and traditional radio newscasts and stories.","We’d expand Public Post to cover more towns and documents and develop it into an open, sharable, scalable web application.

Quantitative Reasoning and Understanding Data for Journalists: An Online and Interactive Book,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25546344237/quantitative-reasoning-and-understanding-data-for,60000,"I intend to create an online, interactive book, bootstrapped off a blog, to take journalists from quantitative thinking through data analysis.","This project aims to develop quantitative and statistical reasoning skills amongst journalists. It aims to help journalists understand the difference between the nature of data and the nurture of data towards existing ideologies or preconceived notions. In a series of chapters, journalists will be taken from simple quantitative reasoning to facility with correlational and causative data analysis and web based visualization.","This book would emphasize fundamentally the importance of quantitative reasoning and skepticism rather than arcane tests, and visualization as a way of understanding real-world data such as the FRED time series. In general, I believe no such interactive, online resource exists.","I hope it will work because of a very gradual approach starting with quantitative reasoning and skepticism followed by a cookbook style approach to actual data analysis and visualization. The aim is to give journalists a language to make quantitative judgements for themselves, and a confidence that even allows questioning the data itself. The hope is that this translates into a ‘asking-better-questions’ stance and a replacement of the ‘false-dichotomies’ problem that journalism currently has with a more nuanced, data based thinking. Finally, the usage of real-world economic, climate, health and other data, coupled with the ability for users to add their own data stories should make for a very interesting ride.","I am. (Rahul Dave). I’ve been a data scientist at Harvard specializing in the statistical analysis of and machine learning for time series in astronomy ( we created the Time Series Center: http://timemachine.iic.harvard.edu). I’ve also worked on semantic web based connections between data and publications in astronomy culminating in a connections database (adslabs.org/semantic). There will be guest chapters from researchers into statistics, economics, and astronomy.","Only the conceptual framework and skeletons for some chapters. The projects rests on much prior art from the R, IPython (web notebook), Pandas, coffeescript, and d3.js projects, as well as some of the work of Bret Victor and followers (for interactivity). And, of-course books like Data Journalism Handbook, and efforts at J-school (for those who went). Teachable ideas are very much inspired by Dave Winer and Jeff Jarvis, except that I think some coding chops are important for journalists. Not all the ideas have been fleshed out, but the intent is to keep as much coding using web based tech as possible.","News Challenge funds would be used to provide limited living funds while I work almost full time on this project or a year (60%). The funds would also be used for travel and evangelization (20%), and for some contract based development of infrastructure (such as a IPython like web based notebook, and a new commenting infrastructure).","The online website will be maintained by using royalties from an offline version of the book, should a book contract arise from the idea. Furthermore, since the book will always be open-access, and always incorporating suggestions from users, I hope to grow a community around it, and different cookbook style analyses added by users which are still pertinent to the chapters."

This app would be an expert systems software equivalent of having a Phil Meyer sitting by the reporter’s side explaining the data.,Existing statistical software like SPSS or R requires expertise to use it and interpret the results. This “black box” would act as the expert for statistically-naive data users.,"The difficult part — statistical analysis — was solved long ago by the creation of many public-domain algorithms. The “special sauce” of this app would be taking the results of such algorithms — descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, z-scores, regression trend lines, outliers, et al. — and packaging them in plain language explainer text and simple infographics.","Project proposer Steve Doig is the Knight Chair in Computer-Assisted Reporting at Arizona State University’s Cronkite School of Journalism; he teaches newsroom statistics and consults on data analysis problems. To build the expert systems portion of the app, he expects to enlist other statistically-competent journalists such as Jennifer LaFleur of ProPublica, David Donald of the Center for Public Integrity, Sarah Cohen of the New York Times, and others.

The website is being used everyday by journalists around the world. Therefore GroundReport is currently collecting useful data and will be into the future. Recently, GroundReport has been reaching out to institutions and individuals who may be interested in studying our data. This project would allow GroundReport to build a more formal set of tools that would make it easier and more user-friendly to access and parse our data for study.","The News Challenge funds would be used to hire programmers, designers, managers, and outreach professionals, who will build the Learning Laboratory and then promote it, targeting institutions and individuals that can use our data for research and education. The funds then can be used to maintain the project in the future.","The Learning Laboratory resources would be made available to institutions on an annual donation basis.

Data will be interactive, accessible and bilingual.","Nonprofit and community groups and effective government leaders support this project because we have consulted with them and heeded their input.  They want, and will receive, accurate data at a micro level (census tract, ZIP code, municipal) in addition to county and statewide.  Data will be accessible on computers, smart phones and tablets.  Selected data will be available in translation for NJ’s 1.5 million Hispanics.  Data will be more current, more interactive, more detailed and more visual.  This will empower government officials and citizen stakeholders to better assess policy impact, hold government accountable and improve the quality of life here.","The project is being implemented by the Rutgers University School of Public Affairs and Administration (SPAA), ranked 7th of 300 programs by US News & World Report.  The project is directed by Dean Marc Holzer, who has over four decades of experience in related data and citizen driven projects; Dr. Stephanie Hoopes Halpin, Assistant Professor and Director of the NJDataBank; and Dr. Roland Anglin and Dr. Kelly Robinson of the Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at SPAA. They are assisted by technical staff and other faculty and graduate assistants.","We have established a prototype (http://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/home/data-bank.html) with a homepage, 20 public policy pages, county and municipal profiles.  Three of the policy areas (civic engagement, health and housing) have been developed to a more advanced level with rankings that compare NJ to other states, contain links to key data sources, and include indices which enable citizens to compare counties or municipalities: The civic engagement index measures political and community participation; the health index focuses on health risk behaviors and the housing index measures conditions favorable for renters, owners and builders. Data collection is approximately 50 percent complete.","$250,000 will vastly improve the NJDataBank.  It will improve interactivity, increase user-friendliness, add sub-municipal microanalysis, automate data input, and translate critical pages into Spanish.  Building on Rutgers’ commitment to completing data collection and analysis, the resulting combination of content and ease of access will empower NJ citizens and improve governance.","Rutgers is dedicated to the project. Once the website is developed, maintenance costs will be manageable with graduate assistants updating the data, using automation, under the faculty guidance of the Faculty. For these on-going costs, we will seek funding from NJ foundations and partnerships with NJ civic groups."

U3‘s work has been covered from the Wall Street Journal to the Center for Clean Air Policy.","Urban3 produced case studies in 17 cities in 8 states, which all validate the hypothesis that community value and revenue are greater in place-based areas. For instance, U3’s work in Asheville, North Carolina proved renovated historic buildings are producing over 800 times more community tax revenue per acre for the city than an acre of big box retailer in placeless sprawl on the city’s edge. Saving historic buildings and helping downtown renovation produces more local wealth and reinforces placemaking. The existing study method and community story will be the genome of the model to be replicated on a larger scale.","The team will analyze property values in the communities that are part of the Knight Foundation’s Soul of the Community project to complement the project’s findings. U3 and CNU will compile the findings into an online database, serving as a repository to help communities develop long-lasting, economically vibrant places.",The potential exists for the public and private sectors to provide the funding to sustain and expand the project after the Knight Challenge funds expire.

In addition, an overlay map will be created to view cancer clusters studied in these areas.","Progress of the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP), overseen by Congress, is well-hidden. Because I’ve followed this program for nearly 15 years, I know how to read and interpret the maps and research coding the work (or waste) at these sites. This is difficult for those who have no experience with it. Therefore, this website will be an intermediary provider of information between government wonks and the public.  ","This website would make it easy for anyone, in any of the above locations, to find historical data regarding the DERP site, its clean-up status and health risks for people who reside there. (Many other communities across the country are listed on the Army Corps’ DERP program, but residents in most locations are unaware that their homes, parks and schools may sit on tainted grounds where chemicals and other debris from past wars may still be buried.) It is difficult for communities to get news and information about DERP sites, from the beginning when community members discover that such a site exists in a community to the end, when the environmental clean-up is completed. Long-term news coverage of DERP sites is nonexistent. It is only when a community discovers that such a site exists that it becomes controversial and is covered by the local, traditional news media. The peak of coverage occurs during its most controversial point and then it tapers off and local residents are left to wonder about the status of the environmental clean-up involved. The project will provide consistent, ongoing coverage of these sites.",R.S. Rock Media and affiliates.,Initial research has been done. Technology will follow.,"Environmental Toxins Estimated Budget (15 months/$150,000)   Project oversight:                                $30,000* Website technical and creative:         $20,000 Research/Content creation:                                   $30,000* Photography/video:                              $30,000* Marketing:                                              $15,000  Estimated taxes due:                               $25,000   Total:                                                   $150,000","It would be our goal to build and expand this website beyond the 15 months of Knight funding and the three communities that will initially be involved. To do so, from the very beginning of this project we will actively seek additional grant funding from other foundations that support the media and/or environmental research. To build the website’s geographic coverage area, we plan to form partnerships with affected communities and the traditional media outlets in those communities across the country that are affected by DERP sites. In the future, there would be a couple of business models we would explore. One goal, of course, could be to create a nonprofit organization which involves the website. Another would be to establish the project as an independent private environmental media company."

This platform would automatically generate local news items for neighborhood readers, then tip off a reporter to what deserves extra narrative or investigation.","There are news platforms that leverage local data. We aren’t aware of any that combine automatic narrative with a dashboard to guide human reporting and community-building, on a local level.","There is great interest in data journalism right now, as evidenced by a vibrant news developer community and attendance at IRE/NICAR conferences. Projects like Homicide Watch show that small teams can do great things. The team in Spokane knows rapid CMS development and data journalism, having built the paper’s digital platforms from the ground up. As an editor at a family-owned newspaper, I can make this project a priority. Participation in the Knight-funded PANDA Project has provided a guide for successful iteration on a project like this, and the reporter we have in mind would provide critical community-building expertise.","The team at The Spokesman-Review will continue developing the platform and relationships necessary to feed it with data, and identify a reporter to lead local coverage. We have relationships with developers at other organizations who have expressed interest in contributing to the project, ensuring that the final product is useful to others. We think this project is a necessary experiment toward proving automatic narrative plus human reporting can turn local data into valuable journalism, even where communities are small and resources are thin.","The team at The Spokesman-Review has developed many local data apps, as well as a site framework applicable to this project. We’ve launched a local instance of the excellent Boundary Service project, providing the geographical underpinnings this would require. We continue to pursue and develop relationships with those who would be our sources of civic data. Other necessary components already exist in the open-source and news-developer communities. The crime reports developed by the L.A. Times Data Desk, for example, provide a template for auto-generated narrative.","To hire a developer and a reporter for a year to prove this platform can produce valuable local journalism. Smaller amounts would go toward promotion, training, and design. We envision six months of initial development, six months of reporting and development, then six months more with the dedicated reporter.","We would seek to continue staffing the local platform with a reporter. Because the code running it will be open-sourced, we would also work with other organizations to help them customize the platform for their communities, based on the data available to them."

Our tools will emphasize data visualization designed to let people see how their climate has changed already, and how future droughts, heat, floods, storms, hurricanes and more are projected to impact their communities.","No one has ever attempted this before. Although climate data and models are currently available to the public they are in raw form that is not usable by anyone except computer programmers and statisticians. We will unlock the power of the information by developing the tools needed to visualize how global warming will change every region of the world. Unlike all previous attempts to communicate climate science, we will thoroughly democratize the data and the experience. In the process, we will transform the average person’s feelings about climate change from something abstract and remote, to something personal and meaningful. ","The project will work because it is technically feasible, is based on the best available science, is completely transparent, and is designed to engage the user. It will work because Climate Central is uniquely qualified to do the work; we have the combination of climate scientists, data visualization specialists and communications experts necessary to conceive and execute the wide range of tasks the project demands. Overall the project will succeed because we will make it clear how climate change has, and will, affect people personally in places and timeframes they care about.","Scientists are constantly gathering new climate data and building new climate models, but no one is currently translating climate model results into something meaningful to the average person, where they live. Climate Central routinely analyzes historic temperature and precipitation statistics (climate data), and we have the unique in-house capacity to produce media-ready local climate content based on this information. As far as we know, only Climate Central uses climate data to produce a steady stream of local climate change research and news products for local TV stations across the country. ","Our staff currently includes IPCC contributing authors (climate scientists, statisticians) who are fluent in the details of the observed climate record and the climate models used to project future impacts, as well as former Weather Channel on-air and production talent experienced at communicating climate change to a broad audience. We have already built the capacity to analyze datasets containing millions of observed temperature and precipitation records, and to produce media-friendly research products that reach millions based on this information. We routinely analyze these data to produce original, local, climate content and graphics for TV meteorologists in 17 U.S. markets. ","To hire the additional programmers, data visualization techs, and web developers needed to execute the project in collaboration with our current team of scientists and communications specialists.",Core support from The Knight Challenge would allow us to launch the program and secure additional support to sustain and expand the program after the end of the funding cycle.

We will enable data that would be archived in print, to be digitally available.","I have 5 years experience in the environmental engineering field, and have spoken at length with environmental scientists and management about the viability of this product. They all agree that it is needed because in the digitization of the data collection alone, there is a 20-30% saving in human capital.  Governments are moving towards Open Data standards too, however private interests seem to focus on unearthing and discovering data that has previously been archived. I believe that our vision around enabling the data repository to be proactively constructed will provide a renewed sense of faith in local, state, and federal agencies in the power of Open Data.

This platform will be open to the public and also include ratings from trained “street teams.” Youth want and need this and we are positioned to deliver.,"SparkAction – the leading website mobilizing action for and by young people – will lead this project, in partnership with several organizations. Ebay has committed to developing the mobile application pro-bono. iMap Ventures is offering their “mapping” technology.  Great Nonprofits is bringing their database of non-profits reviewed at the local level.  The Federal Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs is bringing their national clearinghouse of youth related resources at the federal level. The David Weikart Center will customize their state-of-the-art Youth Program Quality Assessment as a checklist to guide public ratings and training to the “street team” special evaluators.","We have already built SparkAction, the leading website in the industry, with more than 50,000 articles, blogs and stories, and hundreds more added every month. SparkAction has a market reach of more than 500 leading organizations, 10 million staff and volunteers at youth organizations, and more than 50 million young people. The website uses a cutting edge, open source, scalable platform. Our contests, campaigns, and challenges integrate seamlessly with social media; our contests regularly receive more than 1 million media impressions on Facebook alone.","Funding would be used to finalize plans to integrate the assets of our partner organizations to develop and maintain this application, and to conduct publicity, outreach, and street-team recruitment to mobilize widespread use of the Yelp for Youth application.",We have a top-rate track record in securing foundation funds. We would use the Knight funding to leverage additional funding from foundations with whom we have close ties. We will also consider responsible advertising and other means of monetizing this network.

Identifying credible and relevant information in the news will allow youth to make informed decisions about their personal and civic lives. Changing attitudes is a necessary step towards this behavior.,"No tool exists that assesses people’s attitudes about the news as a knowledge source, promotes attitude change and critical thinking, and permits the collection and mining of research data.","Youth in my research state: “Reporters lie through their teeth; there is nothing in the news that matters to my life; and I hate to read!” AttiTool identifies four distinct attitudes about the news as a knowledge source and the motivation to think critically when consuming news (or not). It promotes attitudinal change towards news as a data-supported explanation of a news event. My research shows that youth are motivated to thinking critically when prompted with reasons why news matters to their personal and civic life. The animated, interactive nature of AttiTool engages even youth who ‘hate’ to read.","Dr. Florian Feucht is an Assistant Professor of Educational Psychology and has completed several news literacy studies with high school students to understand their attitudes and critical thinking skills as news consumers and citizens. Feucht has developed effective lesson plans for students to learn how to assess and navigate data in the news and to motivate them to become critical news consumers. Feucht will collaborate with expert animators and programmers at the university’s Center for Creative Instruction to develop the tool. The center has won several, national awards for their educational animations, such as Anatomy &Physiology Revealed.","A paper/pencil version of AttiTool exists with written text (not animated). The assessment part has been psychometrically validated with a diverse population of teenagers (n=500). It identifies four attitudes about the news as 1) copies of reality (no critical thinking needed: seeing is believing), 2) facts (critical thinking needed to verify truth of data), 3) as opinion (no critical thinking needed: news dismissed as reporter’s opinion/ no data), and 4) as evidence-based explanations (critical thinking needed to validate supporting data). The educational recommendations have been successfully tested in different news literacy lesson plans and target the four different attitudes.","The funds will be used to develop AttiTool, including a)     building the tool as an interactive cartoon animation, b)    developing a website (adjusting to pc and mobile devices) and data collection system to embed the tool, and c)     adjusting and integrating the educational recommendations into the tool.","Teachers will use AttiTool to re/assess and tweak learners’ attitudes about analyzing data in informational text (i.e., news literacy) which is a prevalent objective in the new, nationwide Core Standards for English, Math, and Science.

The Public Archive,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25545835812/the-public-archive,0,PublicArchive.org is a “grassroots Data.gov” — a living archive used and run by community groups and citizen scientists.,"Because of work by communities like PLOTS, the flow of data is no longer one-way: citizens can produce their own data to promote community interests. But much of this data lives on hard drives and overflowing Dropbox accounts. PublicArchive will provide distributed P2P infrastructure to keep data safe and accessible.","PublicArchive focuses on preserving, leveraging, and open-sourcing YOUR data from the bottom up, opening it to public discussion and debate with storage, search and annotation tools — a “grassroots cloud”.","The need for such open source tools and self-sustaining infrastructure is apparent: PLOTS and other community data projects have generated unprecedented amounts of new information in the form of photographic archives, sensor readings, and maps. PublicArchive solves the infrastructure problem by asking participants to contribute space to the network — in a “SETI@Home” version of a data archive— where everyone contributes small amounts to a large problem.Having learned from the initial launch of the PLOTS Archive, we see a need for redundant, community-based data archiving and better tools for annotating, connecting, publishing, licensing, and promoting such data.","Based on work from the BP oil spill project in 2010, Stewart Long and Jeff Warren have worked to plan, design, and implement the pilot PLOTS Archive while Shannon Dosemagen has incorporated the archive and data gathering methods into community use scenarios for organizing around environmental justice issues. This team will lead development of the PublicArchive. Additional PLOTS community members involved include RJ Steinert, who works on NSF data management systems and is an active contributor to the Archive project and Chris Fastie and Ned Horning who have begun to plan new features for a generalized community data storage system.","The PLOTS Archive — a prototype for PublicArchive — pulls directly from data-production tools like MapKnitter, MapMill and Spectral Workbench, and provides a place for discussion and interpretation. Also under development are scripts for automatically distributing data to BitTorrent for redundant backup, scripts for analyzing image metadata, and annotation tools for maps and images to make it easy to reference deep, rich datasets from blogs and websites. PLOTS has also built extensive documentation for data collection, visualization, and analysis systems. We’ve helped libraries create local repositories for grassroots data production, especially in areas of low Internet availability.","To jump-start the network, PublicArchive will need servers and storage space in a datacenter, along with a system administrator, full-time digital archivist, and web developer. A developer will create distributed systems for redundant archiving, web interfaces for connecting peers, and will complete the web-based data annotation and sharing tools.","Partnerships will add server and storage resources to the network. As the network grows, storage and server needs will drop with greater participation by peer nodes. PLOTS will manage the network, but sysadmin resources will be contributed by organizational partners who use the network for redundant archiving and data distribution."

This has never been attempted.","In the first quarter 2012, we established “proof of concept” that our media-based data collection methodology is a viable way to gather project-level aid information from donors who are unwilling to disclose sensitive financial information. We will make the data understandable for stakeholders by providing user-friendly mapping tools and visualizations at www.aiddata.org. These data will equip journalists, CSOs, and other local stakeholders with the information needed to sound the alarm when project results differ from what donors promised, effectively closing the feedback loop.","AidData’s Co-Executive Directors are currently overseeing a team of 12 student research assistants to create a comprehensive database of Chinese development finance flows to Sub-Saharan Africa from 2000-2011. AidData staff have also created a geo-coding methodology and toolkit that make it possible to (a) identify the precise latitude and longitude coordinates of these projects, and (b) visualize the spatial distribution of Chinese development finance. If we secure external funds, Global Integrity has agreed to work with a network of investigative journalists to collect timely, on-the-ground information about the status, performance and impact of these aid projects.","We have already developed a systematic media-based methodology to collect project-level development finance information. A team of experienced research assistants is in place to gather data using this methodology. We have also created dynamic online mapping platforms that enable users to overlay, correlate, visualize, and make sense of enormous amounts of heterogeneously-generated, granular data. For example, we recently introduced Development Loop, which enables users to see the locations of geocoded projects in relation to provincial- and district-level social, economic, and demographic data. GlobalGiving’s stories project is another optional map layer, which provides local information from surveys conducted among aid beneficiaries.","The College of William and Mary and Brigham Young University would use the funds to compensate student research assistants and a project manager for time spent collecting project-level aid data using our media-based methodology. Development Gateway would design, implement, and manage the growth of the web-based visualization platform. Global Integrity would support investigative journalists in Africa with a demonstrated interest in and ability to collect project-level performance data.","AidData and Global Integrity have a strong record of mobilizing funds from foundations, governments, and international organizations to support research and innovation activities. We are committed to raising $25,000 a year after the initial grant period to ensure that the data are updated and the web platform is maintained."

Climate data and models are only available in raw form, not usable by anyone except computer programmers. We will democratize climate science like never before. ","The project will work because it is technically feasible, is based on the best available science, and is completely transparent. It will work because Climate Central is uniquely qualified to do the work; we have the combination of climate scientists, data visualization specialists and communications experts necessary to conceive and execute the wide range of tasks the project demands. Overall, the project will succeed because we will transform the average person’s feelings about climate change from something abstract and remote, to something personal and meaningful.","Scientists are constantly gathering new climate data and building new climate models, but no one is currently translating climate model results into something meaningful to the average person, where they live. Climate Central routinely analyzes climate data and we have the unique in-house capacity to analyze the historic climate record (temperatures, precipitation) and produce locally-targeted, easily understood research content. As far as we know, only Climate Central regularly produces local climate change research and news products for local TV stations across the country. ","Our staff currently includes IPCC contributing authors (climate scientists, statisticians) who are fluent in the details of the observed climate record and the climate models used to project future impacts, as well as former Weather Channel on-air and production talent experienced at communicating climate change to a broad audience. We have already built the capacity to analyze datasets containing millions of observed temperature and precipitation records, and to produce media-friendly research products that reach millions based on this information.

We are also OpenStreetMap enthusiasts. Artem, who is writing this proposal, was a mentor for Google Summer of Code for OpenStreetMap during three summers.","At the moment, we are focusing on crawler and web-interface, but even when they will be finished we will continue improving them and adding features. After these main features will be in public beta, we will also work on development of machine learning algorithms that will help to predict what places may be seen on photos.","The funds will be used for development of various components: crawler, web-interface, machine learning algorithms to help predict if a nearby place is visible in photos etc. We also expect that some fraction will be spent on supporting web-servers.",We will minimize expenses: The crawler will be built in distributed fashion so that others could run it. We will also experiment with building it as an extension for a browser. We will also think how to minimize hosting costs. We will experiment with advertising models against the content. 
Texas Tribune Data Tools,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25545823926/texas-tribune-data-tools,303132,We hope to build a collection of tools that make it easier for everyday reporters to include interactivity in stories.,"Our project will give reporters at all levels and across all platforms access to easy-to-use and powerful data manipulation and presentation tools, including graphs, maps and charts. This means more data can be molded into usable, visual interactives, helping traditional reporters give more context to their readers.",Many solutions that help newsrooms implement easy data visualization cost money and require commitments to a specific platform. We want to create a tool that’s free and open for all.,"The members of the Tribune’s dedicated data and technology teams have plenty of experience helping reporters take relatively simple data sets and turn them into interactives and visualizations. But reporters across news organizations want to be able to pull these projects together on their own, and without sidetracking their colleagues. We will build a comprehensive, open source tool that makes it possible for anyone to implement their own charts, graphs and maps. After the visualization is prepared in an easy-to-use interface, the program will generate the necessary code; all the reporter will need to do is embed it.","This toolbox will be built in-house by The Texas Tribune’s technology team, in conjunction with the Trib’s data reporters and visual designers. The Trib’s traditional reporters, many of them unfamiliar with building data projects, will be the guinea pigs for making the tools as easy to use as possible, and for integrating the results into stories and projects.","Very little of this project has already been built. But our technology team and data reporters are incredibly familiar with what exists in the data visualization marketplace, and how little of it is cheaply accessible to news organizations across the globe. They have narrowed down their wish list to several useful tools in particular, from mapping to graphing, that reporters could easily design and customize. ",The News Challenge funds would support the developer time needed to build these open source data and visualization tools. We would also bring an interactive or interface designer in order to ensure that the tool has the maximum functional potential.,"Once the tool is built, we would provide periodic updates to it in-house. As with Armstrong, our Knight-funded content management system, this tool would be built as an open-source project. We would encourage development by the people in the digital media community who use it most."

A free and accessible database of land ownership information disseminated by the land advocacy community will save the public money, time and frustration and engender an era of secure and transparent land ownership.  A service run by the leading digital journalism training institute will guarantee the veracity and reliability of the system.","Internews technology and media experts Mark Irungu and Ernest Waititu will develop and manage the population of and outreach for LandQuest.  The Kenyan Social Development Network’s technology arm, which developed platforms including Uchaguzi (technology monitoring), Huduma (service delivery) and Ugatuzi (budget tracking), will design the Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that organized data by county, owners, land prices, court cases, legal restrictions, GPS and public services.  Journalists will find the data in digital and analog formats and enter it into the RDBMS.  This involves assigning unique identifiers to the land parcels and utilizing Google Maps to enable specific geolocation.","A community of journalists and technologists with experience working together through the Internews Digital Media Program has come together to curate, analyze and visualize government data.  The relationship has enriched the quality of reporting on governance issues and provided the SODNET team with the opportunity to use their skills for the public good.  We also have a network of citizens trained in engaging with their local community radio stations via SMS.  The LandQuest database would bring together the combined skills and communication potential of journalists, technologists and citizens through an online and mobile platform to bring transparency to land ownership.",Phase One data collection training and prototype RDBMS development will inform the distribution of funds for construction of the RDBMS and deployment of data collectors and potential recruitment and training of additional data collectors in Phase Two. Phase Three will dedicate resources to outreach and technical support and evaluation.,"Internews proposes to partner with Kenya’s Ministries of Lands and Local Government and the Nairobi City Council, which have been under immense pressure to address issues of land abuse in the country. Once the database is completed, Kenyans will pay a small fee to search for information about land."

Texas Tribune Public School Finance,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25545817906/texas-tribune-public-school-finance,42869,We intend to build an interactive tool for exploring the way that cash-strapped Texas school districts receive their funding.,"Texas schools receive funding from a variety of intertwined federal and state sources, and through tax scenarios that benefit some districts at the expense of others. Providing citizens with visualizations that allow them to change various inputs and see their effects will promote better civic engagement in determining education funding.","The Texas Education Agency and individual school districts keep financial records, but there is no tool for the public to understand how various tax and spending formulas affect classroom funding.","The Texas Tribune is already well known for its data applications, building the most extensive campaign finance, lobbying and employee salary applications in Texas. Two additional tools — our public schools and higher education apps — will launch this summer. As a trusted source of public education news statewide, we already have an interested and engaged audience. Our technology and reporting teams have relationships with experts in the public and private sectors who are intimately familiar with the pitfalls — and promise — of Texas’ school finance system. We must also bring understanding of this incredibly complex process to average citizens.","The Tribune’s crackerjack team of developers and programmers, our design team, our data reporters and our education reporters — a total of about 4 people — would be responsible for compiling the data, building the application, incorporating design features and planning editorial content around the launch of the tool. The Tribune would also partner with a school finance consulting firm to assist with records procurement and analysis, and interpretation of the statutes and tax policies involved.",We have a public education application under development that incorporates some basic data from the Texas Education Agency around school funding. We also built an interactive budget shortfall tool during the last session that allowed readers to change inputs and produce different funding outcomes. Those two tools combined will serve as the baseline — but our app would be much more labor intensive and complex.,"We will use Knight Data Challenge funds to offset our in-house programming and design expenses, procure school finance and property tax records from state agencies, and pay outside consultants to assist us in understanding and building strong models for how schools are funded.","We will provide annual updates to records, and seeking funding from major and sustaining donors to update the interactive as laws and taxes change. We will continue to use the app as a reporting tool for articles in the Tribune and partner news outlets, including The New York Times."

Texas Tribune Legislative Video & Transcripts Platform,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25545813359/texas-tribune-legislative-video-transcripts-platform,642121,"We will create a visual, interactive platform to link readers to video and transcripts of the Texas Legislature in action.","We’ll collect live video and transcripts for every moment of the legislative session, and develop techniques to search and visualize them. Our video channels and archive tools will help everyone from average citizens to policy groups engage in obscure political processes and understand how decisions are made behind the scenes.","Currently, videos and transcripts documenting the Legislature are inaccessible. Our platform will allow users to livestream multiple channels at once, search transcripts and videos by term, and graph word frequency.","Our interactive platform will create far greater transparency in Texas’ legislative process. Today, citizens can’t livestream multiple hearings or watch both chambers in action at once. If they miss a key moment, they can’t go back and revisit it. Our tool will allow users to alternate between live video channels, and use keyword searches to review transcripts and archived footage later. It will be simple enough for the average citizen, and complex enough to provide analysis for more experienced public policy users. By making lawmakers’ actions more transparent, it will spur additional news coverage of political developments and lawmaker conflicts.","The Tribune’s technology team will develop the programming platform for the interactive and for the live video channels. The Trib’s design team will oversee the look of the interactive to ensure it is visually engaging and user-friendly. The Tribune’s multimedia producers will install livestreaming and recording equipment in each of the legislative committee hearing rooms, and pitch video tutorials on how to use the interactive. We will contract with a team of court reporters to transcribe the daily videos into searchable text.","During the 2011 Legislature, the Tribune broadcast key debates in real time, livestreaming either the House or Senate, but never both at once. We also received funding to record hundreds of hours of transcripts of House and Senate floor debate, and used those to create the “Visualizing Days of Debate” series, which graphed the frequency of keywords to map when major debates occurred. Those concepts serve as the foundation for this project, which provides enhanced video access to public debates and hearings via multiple channels, and adds interactivity so users can search archived transcripts and videos for key words.","The Texas Tribune would use News Challenge funds to purchase equipment necessary for capturing and archiving live video streams, pay for court-reporting services for legislative transcripts, and cover developer time to build both the searchable interactive and the video channels.","Once the initial technology costs are covered, the project will largely sustain itself. The only cost that needs to be accounted for year after year is the transcription, and with seed money to kickstart the project, the Tribune would be in a position to find future donors for those services."

This has never been attempted.","In the first quarter 2012, we established “proof of concept” that our media-based data collection methodology is a viable way to gather project-level aid information from donors who are unwilling to disclose sensitive financial information. We will make the data understandable for stakeholders by providing user-friendly mapping tools and visualizations at www.aiddata.org. These data will equip journalists, CSOs, and other local stakeholders with the information needed to sound the alarm when project results differ from what donors promised, effectively closing the feedback loop.","AidData’s Co-Executive Directors are currently overseeing a team of 12 student research assistants to create a comprehensive database of Chinese development finance flows to Sub-Saharan Africa from 2000-2011. AidData staff have also created a geo-coding methodology and toolkit that make it possible to (a) identify the precise latitude and longitude coordinates of these projects, and (b) visualize the spatial distribution of Chinese development finance. If we secure external funds, Global Integrity has agreed to work with a network of investigative journalists to collect timely, on-the-ground information about the status, performance and impact of these aid projects.","We have already developed a systematic media-based methodology to collect project-level development finance information. A team of experienced research assistants is in place to gather data using this methodology. We have also created dynamic online mapping platforms that enable users to overlay, correlate, visualize, and make sense of enormous amounts of heterogeneously-generated, granular data. For example, we recently introduced Development Loop, which enables users to see the locations of geocoded projects in relation to provincial- and district-level social, economic, and demographic data. GlobalGiving’s stories project is another optional map layer, which provides local information from surveys conducted among aid beneficiaries.","The College of William and Mary and Brigham Young University would use the funds to compensate student research assistants and a project manager for time spent collecting project-level aid data using our media-based methodology. Development Gateway would design, implement, and manage the growth of the web-based visualization platform. Global Integrity would support investigative journalists in Africa with a demonstrated interest in and ability to collect project-level performance data.","AidData and Global Integrity have a strong record of mobilizing funds from foundations, governments, and international organizations to support research and innovation activities. We are committed to raising $25,000 a year after the initial grant period to ensure that the data are updated and the web platform is maintained."
API helps news sites deliver smarter content to readers,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25545798215/api-helps-news-sites-deliver-smarter-content-to-readers,,Create an API that allows news sites to tap into our custom ontology to add rich semantic data to content.,"Our project automatically categorizes articles into very specific subject areas. Sites will be able to sort and give the exact content that readers want, maximizing its value and reach. Readers will then be able to find stories on topics of interest without having to sort through thousands of search returns. ",Our rule based classification system uses an ontology created by journalists to classify news content. It is more accurate than existing systems and accounts for regional language differences.,"News groups seek manual keyword tagging alternatives that are deeper, consistent and more accurate. Many have investigated programmatic solutions, but those come with high costs and often yield poor results.   We’ve invested three years and millions in a system that will greatly enhance the content of our 600+ contributors. It lets them: —push content to tablet/mobile users based on customizable profiles; —relate stories to keep readers engaged and create more connected links for SEO; and —power their internal search engines to filter results for readers.   We plan development of a delivery system that requires little user effort.","A team of 10 editors is building the ontology that powers this ability to discover the “aboutness” of stories. As journalists, they understand how words work together and how their colleagues write news stories. We will continue to build the ontology and take input from outside journalists. If enough news sites use this markup, we will begin to see a standard classification emerge for news stories, making it easier for consumers to search across sites. In addition, our five-person IT staff has built, and continues to refine, custom software to apply the ontology to copy from any newspaper.","We have developed about half of the ontology, and we are already using custom-built software to send 150,000 stories a month through our system to create a product we call SmartContent. We sell this product to clients who are interested in niche news, so we have had commercial success with it. Now we would like to share this XML markup – and, by extension, its success – with all news sites. MCT’s 600+ contributors could use the API for only an initial setup fee; non-contributors would pay a one-time setup fee and an annual subscription fee. ",We would use the funds to hire:  —an outside firm to build the API.  —an outside firm to educate customers on the advantages of using the API and to market and distribute it customers. —additional editors to speed the ontology-building process. ,"Our IT department would work with API developers to learn how the API is built so they could support it. Revenue from setup fees, subscriptions and our SmartContent product would keep the project viable financially, and our strong brand among newspapers will help us implement the project among them."

Texas Tribune Healthcare Data App,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25545760777/texas-tribune-healthcare-data-app,275190,We intend to build Texas’ most comprehensive cross-platform healthcare data application to track hospital and physician safety and quality.,"The Tribune mobile medical app will allow the public to sidestep onerous state agencies, insurance companies, and costly and expensive records requests to access a user-friendly, open repository of previously hard-to-decipher hospital and doctor records — everything from physician disciplinary histories to readmission and infection rates at Texas medical centers.","There’s no app that combines these datasets. Hospital records are public, but are prohibitively costly for news organizations. Doctor disciplinary records exist online, but are unintelligible for the average patient.  ","The Tribune is already well known for its data applications, building the most extensive campaign finance, lobbying and employee salary applications in Texas. Two additional tools — our public schools and higher education apps — will launch this summer. The mobile medical application will give consumers easy access to information they need to make educated decisions, from which hospitals they choose for surgeries or emergencies to who provides their primary or specialty care. Using physician disciplinary records, inpatient hospital statistics, and infection and readmission reports, we’ll provide hospital scorecards and doctor profiles, and map the locations of healthcare facilities statewide.  ","The Tribune’s crackerjack team of developers and programmers, our design team, our data reporters and our health care reporters — a total of about 6 people — would be responsible for compiling the data, building the application, incorporating design features and planning editorial content around the launch of the tool. The Tribune would also partner with a healthcare consulting firm to assist with records procurement and analysis, and interpretation of complex sets of records.","We have a general framework for the application built, because we can use the skeleton of the public and private education apps and scorecards we intend to roll out later this year. We have not yet procured the medical data (a costly endeavor) — and we would have to create original design features specific to the healthcare app. We would also have to build the mobile side of the application, but not from scratch: we expect to have a framework for that built for our education apps by late fall. ","We will use Knight Data Challenge funds to offset our in-house and mobile programming and design expenses, procure hospital and doctor records from state agencies, and pay outside consultants to analyze complicated datasets and determine what factors to include and interpret on consumer scorecards.  ","We will sustain the project by providing annual updates to records, and seeking additional funding from major and sustaining donors to roll out enhanced features. We will continue to use the app as a reporting tool for articles in the Tribune and partner news outlets, including The New York Times."
Forging Data Pathways: From the Amazon to WikiData,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25545758085/forging-data-pathways-from-the-amazon-to-wikidata,250000,Build and organize a local media-sourced dataset about the Amazon rainforest for use in WikiData’s semantic data search engine.,"This project provides a technological means to gather, verify and distribute hyper-local data sets. Data consumers quickly get answers about the Amazon’s conditions based on media-verified data. Journalists become recognized as reliable data sources in addition to trusted news sources. Overall, data is democratized by legitimizing small and locally-focused data.   ",Investing in alternative data mechanisms circumvents Big Data gatekeepers.  We will transform the relationship between data producers and consumers by connecting WikiMedia Foundation’s WikiData with journalists in the field,"A robust, easy-to-use system to curate large amounts of locally-gather data will enrich InfoAmazonia, a data portal for geolocated news that illustrates the relationship between data and journalism, and auto-populate WikiData, a global repository of data that aspires to become a smart database search tool. We are charting a path for data to flow from the local level up to regional and global platforms. This project includes participants from every stage in the process, from collection and verification to analysis and distribution.","Internews, and its Earth Journalism Network, is a media development organization experienced in creating and supporting regional and thematic information portals including OpenOil, Nai and Deriban that explore stories and data. OpenOil has established a partnership with the WikiMedia Foundation, which is currently developing the WikiData platform, to pilot the data entry system and pass that knowledge on to InfoAmazonia, an initiative led by the Brazilian environmental media outlet O Eco. O Eco journalists will initially pilot the data gathering and verification system.",InfoAmazonia beta version was launched and is already working with a network of environmental journalists in the Amazon region that gathers stories to be overlaid with data visualizations of government and NGO-sourced data.  The Pan-Amazon Communicators Network met at Rio+20and began to training reporters and editors in data journalism. InfoAmazonia has functionality to upload stories and download public datasets but not a system to collect and verify important local data such as small patches of deforestation and mining that can’t be identified by satellite. ,"Build tools that feed data into InfoAmazonia and WikiData , systems to prepare participants to gather data, and methods for editors to authenticate data. Teams work simultaneously; InfoAmazonia building the datasets via its users, OpenOil building and teaching the tools, and WikiMedia using the data in its WikiData prototype.","This data layer would fill the local data vacuum while enhancing the utility of InfoAmazonia and the data skills of journalists. The open-source tools adopted by WikiMedia enable aspiring data journalists to contribute and access verifiable data, increase local NGO’s international exposure and create a system for easy future auto-updating."

KnowLodge provides non-profit agencies and local governments the means and support to collaborate by sharing data. In this space - physical and online - we create the atmosphere of data discovery and data-driven advocacy.,"KnowLodge will work because there is growing demand for transparency and access to locally relevant data, but only incremental efforts to meet that demand. Where data is available, it is disconnected and often sector specific. KnowLodge develops and publicizes data sets important to community actors including data on housing conditions, educational achievement, access to health services, etc. Locally produced community surveys and assessments will be shared alongside data from, inter alia, the American Community Survey. KnowLodge lowers the barriers to access and collect data and reduces the difficulty of sharing. By relying on APIs and visualization models and maps, KnowLodge makes data relevant, actionable, and accessible to all.","Open Knowledge Collaborative (OKC) founder, James Quinn, is leading the KnowLodge technical development. James has consulted in information technology for more than 15 years and specializes in data design and business analysis. James has implemented high-profile websites, built complex databases, and led technical and research teams in the U.S. and abroad.OKC staff experienced in civic engagement are working with local non-profits and government to obtain constant feedback and advice. OKC is building the frame and community partners are contributing the priority content. All partners are developing plans for outreach and the long-term use of KnowLodge for data-driven decision making.","KnowLodge is in the design and early implementation phase. An assessment is underway with direct service non-profits and local government offices to identify and release the most critical datasets to include in a pilot version of the KnowLodge. This will include, for example, a comprehensive listing of human services offered in the region. Initial APIs have been developed and tested. The KnowLodge platform and databases have been designed but not yet opened for  public consumption. A search for a publicly accessible office-space for the KnowLodge is underway with the help of city officials. KnowLodge is scalable - OKC and partners will assist other communities to build their own KnowLodge.","Funds will be used to support staff during development of the KnowLodge database, APIs, and user interface. Additionally, funds will support the assessment of priority data needs, creation of visualization components, and development of OKC’s mentoring program. Finally, funds will cover half the costs of establishing the KnowLodge space as well as related visibility and marketing components.","OKC is actively seeking complementary funding from local foundations and government, state government, and private donors to sustain the small staff required to maintain the accessibility, currency, and comprehensive nature of the KnowLodge. Carefully designed incentives will encourage active involvement and current content."

Putting timely data in the hands of citizens has great potential to empower.","As far as we know, there are few projects that attempt to regularly scrape data off of government websites (and media) and push to offline citizens via free SMS subscriptions.","There is a great thirst for information about government plans and activities at a provincial and local level in Mozambique. Mobile penetration is now quite expansive in the country – the newspaper regularly gets SMS and Facebook comments from citizen reporters in quite remote towns and cities. If people were able to sign up for timely updates and data alerts, we envision a more vigilant and informed network of Citizen Reporters.","Our newsroom has recently had an introduction to the concepts of #opendata and scraping, both with a brief session in December, and recent attendance of Data Journalism workshop in Perugia. We would like to contact Hacks | Hackers from South Africa, and work with friends from the local tech scene, alongside our site’s developer who has vast experience with SMS-based mobile applications in Mozambique, including mobile payments.","@Verdade has a history of communicating with its vast offline readership over SMS and innovating with mobile communication including during elections, with classifieds and information on sexual health. The newspaper investigates and publishes reports from Citizen Reporters, both via online channels and in print. However, the newspaper has never provided information/data on demand via SMS. This would need to be built, as well as a system for scraping location-referenced data from government sources.","1) Hold a workshop on #opendata and journalism, if possible with Hacks | Hackers, then identity sources of local data online and on radio to scrape from 2) build a scraping system, and one to push SMS to readers on demand - building in evaluation and feedback mechanisms",We have plans to build a new “Citizen Reporter” platform that will allow privileged readers to support the participation of less-resourced reporters and readers. Our idea is that privileged readers sponsor the data-on-demand SMS subscriptions for offline readers that we develop as a part of this News Challenge.

We offer an efficient and affordable alternative to most communities in the US and abroad.","When surveying drunk drivers where they last drank, about half name a licensed bar or restaurant. A majority of DUI crimes can be reasonably attributed to a consistent few businesses, if only communities had the tools.

Civic and public safety officials benefit by reducing high alcohol crime levels and freeing up critical funds. The public can press civic leaders to motivate business owners to improve. Everyone wins. Safe communities are great for municipalities, businesses and residents.","Limited last drink surveys are being administered in a handful of cities and counties. Many are administered by expensive research scientists and others by public safety officials on limited budgets. As a result data largely remains in geographic silos, typically always out of the public’s reach. We have not found any competitive service that is providing alcohol-outlet licensing alerts or, enforcement activity reporting services on a statewide or national basis.","For licensing and enforcement reporting I built a data service at CALspirits.net, and the first client serves the City of San Diego through SafeSanDiego.net.

Through our network of standards organizations, thousands of special education educators, and accessibility and technology partners (such as Google), we will promote and drive adoption of the tools.","Benetech will develop this project by leveraging work that we and our partners have done on accessible materials in other contexts. Benetech, WGBH’s National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM), and the U.S. Fund for DAISY, created the DIAGRAM Center, which convenes over 20 academic, corporate, nonprofit, and public organizations to research and develop tools to improve the accessibility of graphics in educational materials. Benetech also runs Bookshare – the world’s largest library of accessible ebooks for over 200,000 print-disabled users. Our experience with these projects creates the foundation of knowledge that we will use to execute the current project.","Benetech has already built and launched one web-based, open source image description tool based on DIAGRAM Center research. This tool is meant to work with images from books, especially textbooks, in keeping with the DIAGRAM Center’s explicit educational mission. However, no one is currently addressing tools and content such as web-based infographics. This project will leverage what we’ve learned from our current work, in terms of authoring tools and image alternatives, in order to significantly extend the impact beyond a purely book-based educational context.","Funds will support development of technical specifications and of the authoring guidelines and tools, integration with WordPress and one or more web browsers, and significant outreach and evangelism through our network of partners and Bookshare users. These activities will lead to both the development and use of these tools.","The tools will be incorporated into Benetech’s suite of accessibility tools and will be supported as part of our core operations. Additionally, we will work with developers of authoring tools, web browsers, and screen readers to assimilate our tools into their core products as an additional long-term sustainability approach."

Our system, Justify,provides a rich set of ways to categorize arguments, and automaticsummarization at all levels, making it easier for a reader orjournalist to understand “what the community thinks”.","Today’s unstructured threaded forums provide no help to contributors or readers in identifying how a contribution fits into the overall context of an argument. Advances in decision support, AI and other areas could help, but need to be made accessible, user-friendly, and integrated.","Preliminary experience with Justify has been highly encouraging. People recognize the need for better debate, and express frustration with current systems. Users say they would appreciate automatic summarization features.The UI augments a familiar threaded discussion view with “point types” such as pro or con, mathematical or political arguments, etc.  Justify doesn’t force, but encourages more reasonable discourse. Ideas don’t just “rise to the top” in votes; they can be combined into new, coherent concepts that can survive reasoned critique by other users. Ultimately, entire articles might be authored in Justify, launching a new medium.","Christopher Fry, Research Scientist, and Henry Lieberman, PrincipalResearch Scientist, at the MIT Media Lab are the project leaders.We had 2 MIT undergraduate students working on it in the spring term of 2012, one of whomwill be doing a Master’s Degree on Justify in the next academic year.This summer we have one full time undergraduate student.","We have a working prototype on a small web server at MIT.It has 159 point types, lots of documentation and a web interface.We have started an ambitious re-write using a more scalable language, database,and server (Python, NDB, and the Google AppEngine).See a 3 minute video: http://web.media.mit.edu/~cfry/justify/images/justify_product_design_demo.mp4Read the overview: http://web.media.mit.edu/~cfry/justify/overview.html","Support for Fry’s salary and one MS student, plus overhead.","The Media Lab has over 70 sponsors, the majority from industry.

The projects and programs are developed and implemented by CITY FABRICK staff with support from the organization’s Board of Directors.","The initial project concept has been developed through a previous advocacy campaign.  A modest expansion of the infographic campaign is being initiated through a grant provided by the California Endowment—Building Healthy Communities initiative. The campaigns are to focus on how the character of the physical environment affects public health including (but not limited to) air quality, urban design, mobility, and land use. Partnerships with city government, local community groups, and industry organizations will provide a wealth of relevant information, and the organization will use local media outlets to help reach a broad audience.","The funds will be used to expand the psi program from semiannual to monthly distribution, taking advantage of media distribution cycles to better respond to local events. Specifically, funding will pay for graphic designers to develop the infographics, and to print and distribute materials.","As a 501(c) 3 nonprofit organization, CITY FABRICK is supported through grants, fees for services, and donors.

This allows users to find unique perspectives on information that they might not otherwise be privy to and perhaps make the data easier to comprehend.," There are many ways to visualize geographically-based data (e.g. population, transportation, communication). However, the majority are images or video that force a single perspective on the viewer.","Users are becoming more adept at navigating 3D virtual spaces (like games). The sheer volume of data available from government programs, NGOs and private companies requires a more meaningful way to visualize it. Much of the data collected in the last few years contains geographic content (geo-tagged).

Citizens can ACCESS data, CREATE and PUBLISH applications and mashups.","By eliminating barriers to entry, Criik offers a solution powered by public data for transparency. It’s a data catalog & FOI request workflow, as simple to manage as an email account.","Because it’s quick, easy, free, and simple. It’s the solution many organizations need in order to comply with increasingly expanding FOI and transparency regulations. It’s adaptable to small and large organizations, with a focus on countries whose governments move slower than laws. In Latin America, laws regulate how central public bodies publish their data. In the short term, we anticipate other organizations will also be required to abide by these laws. Additionally, Criik offers this data to the developer community. Finally, the platform hosts the hundreds of civic applications these developers created.","Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente, a Chilean based Latin American NGO that develops web technologies as a means to foster transparency, fight corruption, and promote citizen engagement. A collaboration of developers, designers, journalists, lawyers, sociologists, and political scientists are all behind Criik.org.

We provide intuitive visualizations of the financial impacts of political scenarios. This lets voters assess public policies in ways that had previously been reserved for trained academics, leading to more informed decision-making and a strengthened democracy.","Thinktanks have developed economic simulators but they have restricted them from public access. By creating a free web application, we are opening an information channel that had previously been nonexistent.","In February 2012, we launched a prototype where we simulated the policies of candidates in the primaries. It received a spectacular response: it was used over 300,000 times and it was shared by 1 in 5 users. Moreover, we awarded a number of grants and received national media coverage from U.S. News, MTV, and Mashable.Our experiment validated Politify’s broad appeal and its capacity to engage all Americans with politics. Although our nation has among the lowest voter turnout in the Western world, Politify harnesses today’s web technologies and eliminates the obstacles to learning about politics.","Politify is led by some of UC Berkeley’s most talented students. Nikita Bier (head of product) previously analyzed the impacts of tuition hikes at the University of California system, which went viral and garnered recognition from the state regents. Jeremy Blalock (UX engineer/designer) formerly founded a prolific development studio. Anirudh Todi (backend engineer) previously worked at Facebook and has taken top prizes in the company’s 2010 & 2011 hackathons.In addition, Politify is advised by some of the world’s leading experts in their fields, including Robert Reich (former Secretary of Labor), Professor Emmanuel Saez (a MacArthur Genius Fellow), and Will Glaser (founder of Pandora).","Our team has already built the infrastructure and interface for the web application so that users can visualize the impacts of policies at the personal level. A demonstration can be found at Politify Primaries. Currently, we are currently undertaking a complex merger of Census and IRS data. This will simulate of local and national economies so that any user can input the parameters of a policy and then see the impacts at various geopolitical levels.","We would use the funds in four key areas:- Additional data sets from the IRS ($5000)- Two more licenses for SAS statistical packages ($16,000) - Hiring another data scientist ($75,000) and web developer ($75,000)- Annual administrative expenses ($5,000)","We’ve been able to raise grant money from other foundations without significant difficulty.

With Refer-All, an organization can directly refer a client to a program so that both the client and referred program receive notice. Refer-All increases organizations’ access to data on current services and provides clients with more accurate, actionable information. By standardizing the referral process of a client from one organization to another, Refer-All helps quantify community needs and indicates gaps in services.","Refer-All includes a comprehensive listing of programs data from human services providers. Users may save searches, create hot-lists, and access appropriate translations via our secure API. Refer-All displays information dynamically, rather than relying on static, printed resources.","Refer-All works because it is the most comprehensive, cross-sector, up-to-date listing of available programs and services within the community and uses carefully designed incentives. Refer-All has a large support base: local human services providers have acknowledged the need for the cross-sector, real-time program listing and have asked for integrated referrals. These partners have expressed their intent with letters of support. The interface is simple and fun. Real and social media-like incentives encourage consistent use which will be reinforced by local foundations and governments who have specialized overviews of activity. Finally, Refer-All is scalable, multilingual, and useable in other communities.","Open Knowledge Collaborative (OKC) founder, James Quinn, with staff and interns, are developing the Refer-All Network in collaboration with community partners and local government. James has consulted in information technology for more than 15 years and specializes in data design and business analysis. James has implemented high-profile websites, built complex databases, and developed online GIS mapping applications. OKC Program Director, April Carman, has 8 years experience managing and researching community-based health and human services programs all-the-while pushing for data-driven project monitoring and decision making. Project partners include local non-profits, social services offices, community members, and others.","OKC has completed a brief “market analysis” for similar initiatives. The baseline programs and services data has been collected from existing static sources and a framework for obtaining updates and additional necessary details is being crafted. Databases, the security framework, and the APIs have been designed, while mock-ups have been drafted and a proof of concept has been demonstrated with non-profit organizations, direct service providers, and local government stakeholders.","Knight funds will support staff salary to continue developing the Refer-All database, web-based platform, APIs, and user interface. Funds will cover training and mentoring of non-profits, donors, and government offices to establish program profiles and generate common methods of accessing analytics and sharing results. Funds will provide small but real incentives for full participation.","Refer-All Network will be sustained with grants from local foundations and governments, and private donors. Metrics on use, assistance provided, and number of referrals made will inform this resource development and guide expansion efforts. Funds will be used to ensure information accessibility to low-income families, translations for ESL learners, and incentive programs - all of which will engage participants and ensure their commitment to maintaining Refer-All."
VOTER: The Versatile Online Tabulator for Election Results,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25541612650/voter-the-versatile-online-tabulator-for-election,,"VOTER aims to help news and community organizations collect, analyze and publish live local election data online and in print.","Despite the deluge of data available for state and national races, local elections continue to stymie news organizations, from small weeklies to major-market print, TV and online outlets. VOTER would enable newsrooms to quickly corral, publish and store results without needing a programmer.","VOTER would create drag-and-drop tables to embed data, gathered through manual entry or automated feeds, into any website. No software currently handles the broad variety of local election data. ","In most states, no one—not the AP or election agencies—provides an easy, standard, public feed of local results. Many news organizations use free online tools to cobble together a solution for one night, pray it works and then forget about it the next day. Most newsrooms don’t have developers to build a custom application. We want VOTER to be a tool to generate web forms to simplify data entry as well as attractive front-end tables for web and print publication. If VOTER succeeds, it would enable news organizations large and small to easily get vital local election data to the public.","The data team at the Star-Ledger has been working on unraveling the election enigma for the past year. Our setbacks, as well as the trials and successes of newsrooms around the country, inform VOTER’s development. At the same time, an ad hoc group of journalist-developers has begun a project called OpenElections to build programs to collect and standardize election data from all 50 states. As we envision it, VOTER would have an API to allow data conforming to the OpenElections standard to be flowed into the program. But the real test of VOTER will be to accept manually-entered data and publish turn-key designs quickly.","At the Star-Ledger, we have constructed several election night solutions, including real time results scrapers, that are like the early Wright Brothers prototypes. Their catastrophic crashes will enable VOTER to take flight.","Much of the money will be used to hire Python or Ruby developers to build this web application. VOTER should accept candidate information using a series of drop-down menus or CSV upload to create templates for data entry. After results are in, it would output tables that work in most blogging and news CMSes. ","The journalists on The Star-Ledger’s data team would act as the primary maintainers of the project and continue development after the initial funding period. We expect, however, that other journalists and developers would contribute to the project through an open source repository of the code and testing in their newsrooms."

Pure data are just raw material, so we turn them into beautiful tools that make sense and value for home seekers. We tell them what’s around and the evolution of the neighbourhood.","Very little real estate website take data seriously, especially in France. We convey a wide application for the public and help them have a clear idea of any listing.","Home’n’go helps you aggregate all the real estate listings on your private workspace. It then adds a smart layer of information based on data such as demographics, politics, real estate structure or even transportation. We cross those data with private ones such as locations of supermarkets or services around. Users have therefore all their listings on the same format and powered by key information. We both use Open Data in a private and public way: on any public address if you type in an address on our public tool and on any listing you added on your private workspace.","We are a start-up based in Paris called Home’n’go (homengo.com). Our team is composed of three very complementary co-founders, two engineers and one business girl (HEC Paris), and a tech intern. We have been working full time on the project for the past months. We won an award with a competition organized by the French unit for Open Data (Etalab) a couple of weeks ago as a first mover in this regard. We also promote Open Data with an event called Datapero we created with fellow data startup qunb in Paris (and soon in all France).","We have already built the framework of the project and the Portal part for the public use of the data on homengo.com/immobilier. On the private side (home seeking), the service is also launched and getting some traction (4,000 registrations in 10 weeks). We keep adding data to our service so as to be as precise as possible for our users and to provide them with the more local sources of information. We are national but also adding sets of data according to what cities give us. In that matter, we won a competition organized by the “Saone et Loire”.","We would use the funds to hire key talents to consolidate the team, promote the service and buy data we need to collect now. Having funds already would help us focus only on the product and not on the fund raise we will have to go through in the fall.","We would use money to accelerate the development of the firm and find the perfect market fit to turn Home’n’go into an Open data promoting business. Therefore, the data check part would still be free but we’ll offer services of top of them."

Visualizing relationships entanglements can illuminate complex situations and raise relevant questions. Enabling the use of node-link data (also called “networks”, “graphs”, “linked data”, or “semantic web”) by investigative reporters is therefore of paramount importance.","None of the tools on the market handle node-link properly (e.g. Many Eyes, Tableau, Fusion Tables). Scientific tools deliver terrible visuals without post-treatments (e.g. NodeXL, UCINET, Gephi). Infographics agencies have unpredictable delays.","Timeliness: Publishers already use data visualization to tell stories, but analyzing data is still too complex and time-consuming. Scientific research is mature enough to create applications of node-link data. Team: We believe in the democratization of network thinking. Developing the open source Gephi, we have introduced thousands of “data curious” people and social media analysts into it. Usefulness: Investigative reporters need our platform.

To enable web services, we created metadata in adherence with industry standards and producer-driven needs, and developed an Omeka plug-in with PBCore-adherent element set and output format. The plugins are currently being bundled for release this summer through the Omeka site.","Beta testing, outreach, and user research: Spread implementation of Pop Up Radio Archive from pilot subjects to other producers. Hire additional engineering staff: Expand initial radio-centric plug-ins to suit other media, create new plug-ins, and explore Drupal and WordPress integration. Community development: Create a webspace for instruction, advice, and services.","While some producers will implement Pop Up Radio Archive on their own, others will want to contract professional services, often using private funds or grants awarded for archival efforts. The system can also be monetized as a bridge between producers and a range of Internet content distributors."

With OpenIR’s simple processing and interpretation, this data becomes easy to use and understand. Viewers of OpenIR’s demos have said that this data has many kinds of environmental and urban applications.","Google’s Earth Engine makes some IR data available, but it’s targeted to scientists and technologists. OpenIR will provide IR interpretation tools that help the general public better understand environmental features and risks.","Two Knight Science Journalism Fellows recently wrote about how OpenIR is already a useful tool for understanding the environment and and climate change. OpenIR’s data sources––infrared imagery from international government satellites––have been used by geospatial professionals for decades. There is existing technology to convert this data to imagery, deliver it to the web, and interpret it dynamically, and the team has the technical expertise and design methodologies to implement these tasks. Google Earth Engine, for which the OpenIR team is a “trusted tester,” shows that it’s only a matter of time before live infrared web maps become ubiquitous.

Our advisory board includes Juliana Rotich (Ushahidi) Jeff Warren (Public Laboratory for Open Tech & Science), Steve Chan (Harvard), Lela Prashad (NASA and NiJel.org), and Evan Shulman (Google).","We made several web data previews of manually compiled infrared data. The Jakarta data preview also has a manually compiled tsunami riskmap, based on environmental features (i.e. vegetation, concrete/pavement, irrigation/moisture, etc) that infrared data highlights much more clearly than optical (true-color) data. For these prototypes, the data source is the medium-resolution Landsat satellite. Software tools and libraries include OpenLayers, OpenStreetMap, GDAL, and ImageMagick. Our next steps include automating prototype compiling, incorporating higher resolution datasets like ASTER and IKONOS, and dynamically generating interactive map legends and annotations.","Funds would be used to pay stipends to team members not covered by MIT research funding. A dedicated data-processing computer would be purchased. Funds would also help supplement OpenIR’s initial deployment in ecologically vulnerable areas of Indonesia, a deployment already partially covered by an MIT IDEAS Global Challenge Award.","We will apply for large government and philanthropic grants in the coming months.

Our experience building the open source map design studio TileMill and our work with the larger ecosystem of open source geo tools will inform our development. We’ve developed other components these projects will rely on, like data APIs, and have started to collaborate with OpenStreetMap core developers on necessary changes to the web site and services. Our team also has experience with actually editing and contributing to OpenStreetMap.","We want to build new, user-friendly contribution tools for OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap continues to grow dramatically (http://ds.io/KJlG8U), but there’s more to be done to create a free and open world map. Right now most cities are on the map.

Tracking the Success of Adoptions in America,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25423076916/tracking-the-success-of-adoptions-in-america,,Start a movement toward universal tracking of the success rate for finalized adoptions of children in foster care.,"By establishing a pilot project with one or more child welfare agencies to create a non-identifying data tracking system to gauge the frequency with which adopted children are returning to the system, and partner with state-level entities to solicit information on adoptions directly from children.",There is currently no effort at the federal or state level to measure the success and stability of  adoptions of children who enter adoptions from the foster care system.,"One major challenge with adoption success tracking is that child welfare records do not remain open upon finalization. The case number that keeps a child visible during contact with child welfare is no longer attached to the child.   We believe it is possible for a child’s social security number to reveal a second entry into the child welfare system after adoption. If a child welfare record is continuous throughout child’s life, the ONLY youth whose SSN would register twice with a system would be one whose adoption failed or resulted in a re-entry into the system for some reason.","The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute has been diligently working to raise awareness about the issues around failed adoptions, and we hope to partner with CCAI to shape the project. Experts at the University of California-Berkeley’s Center for Social Science’s Research and USC’s School of Social Work will serve as consultants in the practice of tracking children as they come in and out of the system.","This project is only a concept at this point. We have working relationships with all of the partners necessary for this project, but will need to find agencies/jurisdictions willing to participate in the pilot component of this project.",The challenge funds would largely fund the development of an interface that enabled the pilot project partners to track children re-entering foster care. A portion of the funds would pay for reporters’ and editors’ time to draw in anecdotal information from adopted foster youth.,"Our intention is to draw attention to the issue with information from former foster youths, then document the pilot project in an effort to build a model for tracking adoption success without compromising privacy. In conjunction with our partners, we would raise funds from interested philanthropists to replicate the model."

Sequential data is a ubiquitous and abundant resource in life sciences, healthcare, intelligence and finance, but its unstructured nature makes large amounts of it “dark matter” from the point of view of information, insight, and decision.","People discover patterns from unstructured sequences using domain-specific heuristics, human intuition, or physical experiments. None of these approaches (and no current pattern discovery software) scales to petabytes of data and to thousands on machines.","Because big-data science and businesses need a general-purpose, high-performance telescope for patterns.","Search engine companies, but they do not allow people to discover subtle patterns in sequences as would be required e.g. to discover a law of nature from terabytes of signals in high-energy physics. Data analytics and visualization companies (e.g. Palantir, Skytree, Tableau) focus on structured, numerical feature vectors rather than on extracting patterns from unstructured data.

GenderTracker - Shrinking the News Gender Gap,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25423069820/gendertracker-shrinking-the-news-gender-gap,,Our goal is to shrink the gender gap in news by analyzing & monitoring progress. We will build a live system deployable by newsrooms that tracks gender representation in articles through byline + article text. It will offer daily views as well as over-time change of various gender-balance metrics. Both the system and analysis techniques will be released as open source. ,"We will process news articles in real time (daily, as well as archive data) to extract gender representation metrics from bylines and article text. Sample metrics include byline author gender, pronoun gender usage, cited source gender etc.  By working with news organisations, our tools will help newsrooms monitor gender in the context of all their goals. By offering a window into performance over time, we will provide a way to measure impact and highlight areas in need of attention.","Current gender representation monitoring (such as the GMMP) is conducted manually, supporting, mentorship and advocacy. The monitoring is contained to a selected period. We plan to help newsrooms use their data to take gender into account in internal decisions by tying it to their own publication.","The following reasons will contribute to the project’s success: 1. Project Lead (Irene Ros) has experience in the following areas: Data Visualization (e.g. Many Eyes), Text Analysis (e.g. Many Bills), Byline Analysis (NYTWrites) and Open Source Tools in Support of Journalism (The Miso Project.) 2. Utilizing existing and creating new ties to newsrooms will be a priority to build collaborations around the design of the system and obtain practical data and secure initial deployments. 3. We have working prototype gender analysis code from Nathan Matias (see #5) that will guide the initial designs of the system. Additionally, we are working with an initial dataset to help guide us in developing the metrics required. 4. Bocoup’s commitment to the Open Web through open source and community building will ensure the project development is transparent and in-line with the needs of interested parties. ","The project is sponsored by Bocoup, LLC (http://bocoup.com) under the guidance of Irene Ros. 2-3 interns will join the project at various points in time and contribute to all aspects of the process. Nathan Matias from the MIT Center for Civic Media will advise and support adapting gender analysis software he developed for his research.",We will inherit code and inspiration from Nathan Matias’ work on analyzing New York Times byline & article text over time.

The system is designed to autonomously collect data from practically any source, and to eventually put them into the same context, thus improving both efficiency and effectiveness of analysis.","The system is evolvable and highly autonomous. It needs human intervention only in rare occasions. During time, system evolves to be more precise which additionally reduce need for external interventions.","Data sources are everywhere. However, many of these data are unstructured and need to be sorted and analyzed before trends and patterns are revealed and action can be taken. The proposed system solves this problem by: (i) performing evolvable automated process of collecting, analysis and sorting of unstructured data and (ii) allowing users to define the type of events and/or trends for which the whole evolutionary system is designed. As a final result, unstructured data can be sorted, categorized and understood within user defined context so that information from diverse sources may be used to drive predictions and decision-making activities.","Prof. Yukio-Pegio Gunji, head of the Nonlinear Science Laboratory, Kobe University, Japan Prof. Andrew Adamatzky, Department of Computer Science, University of the West of England, Bristol, UK.

Collective Impact: Using Data to Create Child Well Being,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25175762439/collective-impact-using-data-to-create-child-well,25000,CSC wants to expand the use of data with more community partners to achieve results for Broward’s Children and Families.,"By creating a web based platform, CSC can share data and strategies from the Broward Children’s Strategic Plan more effectively and to more community partners. CSC uses the simple, plain language approach of Results Based Accountability (Friedman, 2005) to communicate the progress and opportunities of the Broward Children’s Strategic Plan. ","  Currently, CSC posts one-page reports from committees in a static fashion on its website. An interactive, dynamic distinct web portal will increase the use of the data-driven planning process. ","Currently, there are a few businesses, parents, youth, and other community partners in the Plan. By creating an easy to understand and easy to access website, we can connect larger groups of partners. We can share this information through a digital portal with Chambers of Commerce, Parent Teacher Associations, Youth Groups, Neighborhood Associations, and Higher Education Institutions. The one page report, in plain language, communicates efforts to improve community conditions of well-being for children and families. For example, interested partners can connect with countywide efforts to decrease infant mortality or improve results for children aging out of foster care.","The Children’s Services Council of Broward County (CSC) is the anchor entity for the Broward Children’s Strategic Plan. CSC provides leadership and resources for the community-wide process. The Plan has a Leadership Coalition, comprised of local, child serving CEOs and policy makers, and 20 committees of program directors, youth, and community members. The committees are working on improving child and family results. Each committee generates a one-page summary (called a Turn the Curve report) that uses data to show how we are doing on achieving the desired result. ","The Plan has been in place since 1999. The committees have existing Turn the Curve reports that are reviewed by the Leadership Coalition on a quarterly basis to provide oversight, resources, low-cost/no cost solutions, and partners. The Turn the Curve reports are posted on the CSC website under the 2012 Broward Youth Summit. Currently, CSC uses Results Based Accountability to communicate the progress the Broward Children’s Strategic Plan is making on creating community conditions of well-being for children and families.  ","The funds hire a consultant to design and build a website that uses social media with RSS feeds, forums for online dialogue, and data sharing. The consultant would work with existing Plan members and potential new Plan partners. Funds would also be used to market the plan to community partners. ",CSC would seek resources from community partners who benefit from the work of the Children’s Strategic Plan. We successfully partnered with sponsors for the 2012 Broward Youth Summit and anticipate engaging sponsors for the website site.

This project is designed to make it easy to do, giving reporters and researchers context when reporting on the social safety net. The site will refine data from the Illinois comptroller’s office in a format that is searchable and geo-coded.","There are websites designed to help locate resources (like iFindit Chicago and PurpleBinder), but this project is focused on tracking funding, spending, and late payments over the last ten years.  The Illinois Comptroller’s ledger website gives a summary of information, but does not give detailed or historical data like this site will.",The data is available via FOIA requests; it’s just not refined and published to the point where it’s useful. I am in contact with the Illinois Comptroller’s office and have worked out a way to get the necessary data. I used the first part of this data to build www.chicagosocialsafety.net. The site tracks state payments to social service non-profits in Chicago for the last ten years. There are already open sourced websites that do a good job of visualizing funding data like www.lookatcook.com. The lookatcook.com site would be used as a model for visualizing data.,"Christopher Whitaker – State worker and graduate of DePaul University’s School of Public Service with a Masters of Public Administration degree.  I completed the current site as part of my graduate level capstone project.

This map is overlaid on top of a map of food insecurity in Chicago. The site also has a data set of city payments to non-profits. The site also takes advantage of the Timeline tool and gives an overview of the economic recession and how it has affected Illinois. I am currently in the process of merging the city payment data with state data in order to map it. However, this is a time intensive process.   ","The majority of the funds would be used to hire a developer and to pay myself a salary in order to work full time on this project. Funds would also be used to rent a desk at a co-working space. Because of the large amount of data, temporary help would be hired to help with data entry.    ","Both www.chicagosocialsafety.net and lookatcook.com use Google Fusion tables to store data. The ease of Fusion Tables means that once the site is built, it will be easier to update the site with new data on a yearly basis. We will also try to work with the Comptroller to get this data regularly released on metrochicagodata.org, which would allow for automated updates through Socrata’s API."

We also have reporters and decades of archives to add critical context. We’ll provide raw data, sure, but also help you interpret it.",Many sites provide data but rely on the community to make sense of it. We will provide focused datasets layered with the kind of rigorous context only Crain’s can offer.,"In the last three decades, Crain’s has developed a pretty good idea of what data is – and isn’t – important to our community. We have merely lacked the resources to bring it all together in a coherent package to create a one-stop destination. This grant would allow us to improve and unify our data presentation. We will create open-source tools that would be portable to other markets, especially the cities who are working together to standardize their open data portals – Chicago, New York and others. Both desktop and mobile (handheld, tablet, etc.) users will be considered from the outset.","Matt Carmichael, Crain’s Senior director of research and data will oversee the project. He has more than 15 years in business journalism experience and has spent his career developing new technologies to distribute news through Web and mobile channels. He’s also a big data geek, and was the keynote speaker at last year’s Association of Public Data Users conference in Washington, D.C. In addition, the staff of Crain’s – writers, editors, graphics production and technical staff – will be involved in every aspect of supporting this project. We will also draw support from our sibling publications as needed.","We have data applications in use with a varying degree of automation (Chicago Real Estate Daily’s Closer section, and our award-winning MarketFacts for example). They are built mostly on open platforms (Django, Python), but are not currently open-sourced. We would, of course, change that. We also have data streams and agreements with outside sources we haven’t fully leveraged yet.",Basically it would allow us to hire a developer and devote additional staff time to a project for the public good without having to balance that desire with the need to monetize it.,The goal would be to create a self-sustaining (and open-source) framework. Once built (and iterated a couple of times) it would be supported by the rest of the Crain’s operation moving forward. So the money would go into building something we couldn’t otherwise. Maintaining we can do/budget for.
World Salon,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25174659439/world-salon,5000,Produce and deliver e-book files of 50 works of literary translation to public library branches across the five boroughs in New York City.,"Our project will allow underserved readers from communities who may not have access to well-stocked bookstores and/or libraries to be exposed to literature from all over the world. We have put vast resources behind translating, editing, and producing these important works; our project will increase New Yorkers’ access to information and culture.","Our project will allow us to directly reach an expanded readership. It’s scaleable: once a pilot program is successfully implemented in NYC, we could partner with libraries all over the country. And uniquely, it is paired with a public programming component: readers can meet each other and engage with the books at one of five Salon readings and panel discussions to be held in each borough.","Readers in communities that lack a thriving arts and culture scene or well-stocked libraries and bookstores do not have access to quality literature, and especially not to translations. It is our belief that artistic exchange between cultures is a crucial component of global understanding. Once we make these vital works available to NYC residents, they will be able to access not only the books themselves, but enriching literary events. We will advertise our public Salons in the digital books and invite readers to attend any and all of our programs in the five boroughs. Because the project has both a public lending component and a programming one, it will both promote cross-cultural understanding and create communities around reading.","David Bullen, our production editor and designer, will design the pdfs and prepare them for file conversion. He is the recipient of numerous awards and was the Art Director and designer of North Point Press for eleven years.   Florence Lui, associate editor/publicist, and Jill Schoolman, Archipelago’s publisher, will head the outreach and development for this project, including working with established sponsors, finding new partnerships, and marketing program events to a diverse constituency.","The majority of the work—acquiring, translating, editing, designing, and producing the 50 books—is already done. These are fully formed works of literature; the remaining work involves conversion of files and outreach and marketing. We have already established partners in all five boroughs, including Queens Council on the Arts, Staten Island OUTLoud, Bronx Writers Center, Asian American Writers Workshop, the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Public Library, and Brooklyn Arts Council. They will spread the word to their diverse constituencies.","The funds would go toward the costs of implementing our project. These include production related costs, e.g. converting pdf files into device-specific formats, including .mobi files and .epubs; and promotion and outreach cost related to marketing the public lending initiative at library branches and local arts and community centers.","The project is scaleable: once the files are converted and our books are out and available for public lending, readers will continue to be able to access quality world literature from libraries, even if they live in underserved neighborhoods."

This will get the information out in reader digestible chunks. Have been doing for four years with current Web site, DelanoNow.com in Delano, CA. Want to franchise to surrounding communities.","This is a partnership with city officials, promoting what is happening in the community. It helps tremendously with economic development. It also promotes the community to those who have moved away.","It will work because it is a positive news project. City officials like it because it promotes the community to those inside and outside. Readers like the positive stories being written, and seeing themselves reflected in the online pages. Once online, with city, school and business officials working together, it becomes self-sufficient, because by selling advertising/online marketing memberships, it will pay for itself and provide a profit to the community itself.","Myself, Eugenio “Gene” Garaygordobil. City of Delano, CA officials. I have more than 25 years as a writer and editor, at the Fresno Bee, The Bakersfield Californian, The Riverside Press Enterprise and the Visalia Times-Delta.","I have built a BETA version that I have been working with the City of Delano, CA.

The data can plug into the existing Ushahidi platforms, with visualizations on a map, timeline, and analytics.","No platform allows for the collection of both human and machine inputs and offers tools for comparing, visualization, and analyzing. The meta data from these comparisons is extremely useful.","Ushahidi has considerable experience in data collection, management, and visualization. The Ushahidi and SwiftRiver platforms are built, we now have to work with existing sensor-data archives and streams such as Pachube to standardize sensor data so that it can be easily inputted and read by the Ushahidi platforms. We have started by hosting a hackathon called “Water Hack” in partnership with Cosm (formerly Pachube), and built a pilot example. However, to make integration intuitive for the user, and to standardize the information will take more work. We have outlined a timeline and can feasibly complete this project in nine months. ","Ushahidi specializes in building crowdsourcing tools for information collection, data visualization, and interactive user experiences.

Our CTO, David Kobia, will be leading the sensor integration project along with our Ushahidi Core product manages Linda Taboi and Angela Oduor. We will work in partnership with Cosm, a sensor data archive platform, as the initial input source. Partnering with Cosm will give our users access to over 1 million sensor streams. We will also use the Twilo API to build an alert system.",The Ushahidi and SwiftRiver platforms that will host the sensor data have already been built. The sensor data needs to be converted and standardized and converted into a valuable user interface. During a co-hosted hackathon with Pachube called “The Water hack” we built a prototype that integrated water-level sensor data with the Ushahidi platform for flood level management. This has helped us to chart out the required development pathway.  We have begun conversations with Twilio about building an alert system on their API into Ushahidi. These alerts could go off when sensors report out of the ordinary activity.,"We would use these funds to 1) hire a developer with sensor database management experience. 2) Build a team for this expansion to the Ushahidi platform, including hiring data scientists and visualization experts to build analytics and comparison tools. 4) Conduct a prototype and test. 5) Launch a final version.","The ability to compare crowdsouced information with sensor data is a valuable research tool. Ushahidi is free, but with the addition of these valuable tools we will adopt a freemium model. To access multiple sensor streams, or to conduct detailed analysis for instance, there will be a fee."

News consumers, when using our platform, can also be news producers. ‘News Fusion’ will facilitate a more accurate, interesting, entertaining and visual news conversation.","I know of no other free and open source, 3D news and data aggregation software, running on both the desktop and mobile, at this time.","Technologically, this platform vision is within reach of my own technical abilities. Moreover, several aspects of the system have already been prototyped. The general idea of news as a conversation is already widely embraced. I believe that free and open news coupled with an interactive, immersive, 3D user experience will provide an even more compelling and entertaining news gathering experience for average PC and mobile user. News delivery formats on the web currently lack timeliness, context, supporting data and interactivity for today’s data and news hungry citizens. This platform will attempt to fill that niche.","James Caple will be Lead Architect and Software Engineer. James has over 18 years of experience designing, developing, testing and supporting enterprise applications in both the US Government and private companies. James has provided technical leadership in two successful, early-stage startups where he helped dream-up, design and implement software products central to the business focus. One company, ‘Riverbed Technologies’, was sold for $880 million during the early 2000’s. ‘TaxiMagic’ was the other startup. A resident of the Washington DC area, James has a number of local contacts in the software field; recruiting additional part-time help through this network is anticipated.","This idea has been percolating for a number of years. Some map-focused prototypes were built in C++, Java and Adobe Flash some years ago. An Android application was built with a similar focus as part of another competition. Other prototype code has been built for website screen scraping and social media feed ‘slurping’ to gather knowledge of some possible means for gathering data and news from disparate sources. The knowledge learned from these prototypes can be quickly brought to bear in developing a fast, robust, cross- platform system.","Funds will be used to support one full-time Senior Engineer for year as well as a part-time Engineer and Designer. In addition, funds will be used to purchase 1 development machine and two monitors, corporate entity formation, as well as web site hosting for the project.","The platform would be designed and developed with the intent to be able to also market and sell into various enterprise verticals, such as News and Media, Financial and Governmental Agencies. The plan is to be self-supporting through enterprise sales and other commercialization aspects once seed funding dollars are used."
Mapping a Changing Population: Empowering Arizonans to Write Their Economic Future,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25173683723/mapping-a-changing-population-empowering-arizonans-to,40000,"To create an innovative, interactive tool displaying Arizona population projections and shifts through 2030 for key demographic and social variables.","Making data projections to 2030 accessible will enable both citizenship engagement and public policy decision-making in a very compelling way. Increased awareness and actionable data will help Arizona avert impending crises in critical areas like education, poverty and health insurance coverage, while highlighting persistent ethnic disparities that threaten collective prosperity. ","These projections are proprietary, therefore not widely accessible to the public. This will be Arizona’s first free tool linking demographic projections with numerous social variables in a single, interactive map.","The time is right. With illegal immigration into Arizona at net zero, civic dialogue about Arizona’s economic future is less distracted by this divisive issue. Attention is shifting to today’s demographic reality. Latinos comprise 30% of Arizona’s population (more than 50% by 2040); 41% of Latinos are 19 or younger and 97% of those under 5 are U.S. citizens. If Latino educational attainment, poverty rates, and health status remain constant, Arizona’s available talent, tax base and quality of life will begin suffering by 2030. This project will present an economic argument for collective prosperity based on data, not rhetoric.","Morrison Institute for Public Policy (MI) at Arizona State University, Arizona’s first independent think tank, will lead the project. MI has a strong reputation for applied public policy research; executive director, Susan Clark-Johnson, has a noteworthy background in journalism, most recently as President of Gannett’s Newspaper Division. MI has proven expertise in community indicator systems, managing ArizonaIndicators.org, a web-based resource and analysis tool centralizing data showing Arizona’s competitive position and trajectory. It presents interactive visualizations, mapping tools, public opinion data and policy briefs to promote data-driven decision making.","MI already manages ArizonaIndicators.org, a site perfectly designed to host the mapping tool. ArizonaIndicators.org is a nationally recognized leader in the community indicators field and was highlighted in the U.S. GAO report, Key Indicator Systems. Furthermore, as a founding member of the Open Indicators Consortium, we have already invested in the development of an Open Source tool, WEAVE, which will serve as the platform for the interactive mapping tool. And, MI has purchased Geolytics population projection data through 2030 and recently published a seminal study on the future of Latino educational achievement and Arizona’s economic future.","Funds would be used to purchase additional projection data, contract a statistician to perform analysis, and support staff time required to build a customized WEAVE interactive mapping tool. Additionally, funds would be applied to communications, social media use and direct outreach to publicize the tool and stimulate dialogue and action.",We will permanently host the tool on ArizonaIndicators.org. Most data updates will not be essential until the 2020 census. Additional funding will be sought to support the publication of related policy briefs.
"A Dynamic, Interactive, Online Interface for the State New Economy Index Data",http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25173678121/a-dynamic-interactive-online-interface-for-the-state,4500,"We will create a web-based, interactive version of the 2012 State New Economy Index, which benchmarks economic transformation in states.","Static data tables are difficult and time-consuming to analyze. A dynamic infographic would allow policymakers and researchers to drill-down to compare metrics and trends, improving policy decisions. Journalists would quickly gauge the structure of state economies, saving time. Businesses would easily assess metrics important to their operations, improving their efficiency.","SNEI gives policymakers actionable information by measuring economic structure instead of merely performance. The online version will be interactive, accessible, and embeddable. The data will be freely available to download.","The interactive infographic will improve the usability of an already reputable and valuable dataset. The SNEI has been published by ITIF three times since 2007 and has become the go-to benchmarking tool for state governments and policymakers seeking to adapt their economies to the new globalized, innovation-based world economy. It has been featured in prominent media outlets, including C-SPAN, CNN Money and USA Today, and is used by academic researchers. The interactive version would provide this established user-base a more accessible interface for accessing the SNEI data. It will also help less technical users understand the trends and rankings.","The 2012 SNEI will be published by ITIF and the Kauffman Foundation. ITIF is a non-profit, non-partisan think tank. The authors are Dr. Robert Atkinson and Luke Stewart. Dr. Atkinson is president of ITIF. He has an extensive background in economic and technology policy and is a valued adviser to state and national policymakers. Prior to ITIF, Dr. Atkinson was vice president of the Progressive Policy Institute. He has a Ph.D. in city and regional planning from UNC Chapel Hill. Luke Stewart is an economic analyst at ITIF. He has a B.A. with highest honors in economics from UC Berkeley.","ITIF has published the SNEI three times since 2007 as a printed publication. We released the most recent version of the report in November 2010, and we will update the report in November 2012. The interactive, web-based infographic will utilize the datasets from each report, allowing trend analysis and comparisons over time.  The data include metrics on knowledge jobs, globalization, economic dynamism, digital economy, and innovation capacity. The data sets used to construct the 26 economic indicators produced for this project come from various sources including government, think tanks, and market research firms.",We will use the funds to hire an experienced information graphics designer to develop an interactive version of the 2012 SNEI so that individuals can better access and use the key data from this report. We estimate this will take the designer approximately 75 hours at $60 per hour.,"The Kauffman Foundation has provided ITIF funding to update and maintain the SNEI and we anticipate continuing to update the SNEI in future years. The interactive, web-based visualizations that we develop will be extensible so that we can reuse them in future years without additional development costs."

California Common Sense - Democratizing Data,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25173667082/california-common-sense-democratizing-data,0,"We’re making government data more accessible and approachable. We aggregate, interactively visualize, analyze, and distill it into digestible information. ","Government data is increasingly available, but often dispersed, unclean, and confusing for ordinary citizens. Investigative journalists traditionally made the raw data intelligible for a broader audience, but today, news staffs are shrinking. With CACS, citizens and journalists can find and easily explore the data in a single place.","CACS doesn’t stop short by simply aggregating data or generating reports. We create various levels at which a user can truly engage – datasets, briefs, full reports, interactive visualizations, timelines, and infographics.","Propelled by the emergence of broader, quicker, more direct communication methods, the movement to open government information to citizens is gaining momentum. Beyond that, the movement is seeing participation from across the entire political spectrum, from government and non-government entities, and from various sectors. Everyone wants more information, but someone needs to process the data first. That’s where CACS comes in. For cash-strapped governments, we aggregate and clean data. For overloaded journalists and bloggers, our visualizations and reports offer great springboards. And for busy citizens, our infographics and briefs are great primers. People are demanding data and information, and CACS is delivering.","The CACS team is passionate and dynamic. The organization began in 2010 when a group of Stanford undergrads got together and developed an interactive map of California’s government structure. Our team combines backgrounds in computer science, statistics, economics, political science, education, history, and research methodology. Our Research Director is completing his PhD dissertation at Berkeley and our Executive Director worked in DC after completing her B.A. in Political Science at Stanford. We love data, technology, and their synergy with 21st century media. ","CACS first developed an interactive map of the California state government to make it easier to understand. We then built a California transparency portal that featured interactive data visualizations of the state’s historical revenue and expenditures, budget, and other issues. We’ve recently begun to develop infographics that feature various statistics about government. The infographics are quick to digest, easy to share, and an effective place for new users to start their data exploration. Our data is currently focused around the California state level, but some extends to the California city and county levels, as well as other states. ","We would open even more data for California and other states. CACS would develop an extensive downloadable data warehouse. Users would finally have free access to clean, customizable .csv files whose raw data is currently dispersed or only available through public records requests. With more analysts we’ll process and visualize more data.","We now exist through the generosity of individual Californians and local foundations. Through this project, we would expand our reach across the nation, making the data warehouse and our visualization tools more available to Californians and non-Californians. That would enable us to raise funds among a diverse group of supporters nationwide."

We will ask community partners to beta-test the site throughout development, to assure it will be accessible to our target audiences.","The project is based on a NYC tool we produced that helps people visualize neighborhood demographics and how those relate to local housing costs and affordable housing policies. The NYC version uses a fixed database, but we plan to adapt it to use real-time, dynamic information to auto-generate interactive maps for all 366 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas. We would include HUD’s “fair market rent” values, but allow users to adjust them to see who can “afford” to live in a neighborhood based on the rent level. We would include federal affordability programs and show how they relate to income. http://envisioningdevelopment.net/map","We would use the funds to hire a team made up of a graphic designer, a user interface designer, and engineers to help build out the site. We would also cover some of the costs of CUP’s staff time to collaborate on and oversee the project.","We would pay for the ongoing infrastructure through a combination of grants, individual contributions, and sale of our physical and print-based tools, which is how we fund our overall operations. We see the ongoing maintenance and updating of this project as core to our mission."

The goal of the project is to make this data emerge and prove it useful and actionable.",There are some self-tracking devices currently on the market mostly catering to the fitness crowd. None of the devices / services provide neither the social interaction layer nor predictive capabilities.,"It will work because technology already exists (or can be tweaked / developed) to collect personal data such as location, heart rate, physical activity, sleep etc. It will work because this data can then be analyzed within context of other people’s data in order to build predictive models. It will work because such models can be utilized in a PDSS. It will work because consumers may get self-tracking devices and PDSS in exchange for their data.

CITY LIGHTS,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/25035674158/city-lights,,"Design an interface to visualize data about the buildings you occupy, revealing performance, experience, energy, and history using government data, user generated data, and research… any data we can cultivate! Data! ","New media has the power to illuminate the world, and reveal data in an easy to read way. With more people living in and moving to cities than ever, there is more of a need to highlight and visualize how buildings are working and where there needs to be improvements. This is an urgent need, and by designing an easy to use, colorful, dynamic site that gathers data regularly, city officials and residents can see the truth behind buildings.","I’ve studied and worked with some architecture websites in the past and have learned from their mistakes. I won’t mention them specifically, but while each has their own positive merits they usually fail because they focus on only the buildings that are uploaded by users. The goal here will be to design a vibrant interface that already provides all of the buildings on day one, with government data already available and visualized. Then the user can add on to that. ","Cities have their own energy, life, experiences. About half of the world’s population lives in cities, a number that will grow to 75% by 2050. While we like to think of cities as being rational, modern, and controlled, there is a lack of illumination on what is actually happening there. By making information about the performance and experience of buildings more easily available, greater attention will go towards their improvement. By visualizing building data, this application will serve as a place where people can get information about the buildings they occupy. It is extremely important that the built world be illuminated by media technology. ","As the lead designer, I will form a team in the new media world, consulting with [confidential] in New York. I will also consult [confidential] to deal with open data. Of course, any other contacts from the Knight Foundation would be helpful as well.  I will work with a marketing specialist to make sure the site is used. ","I have designed prototype visuals for how the site will look and function and have completed graduate work on the concept. Of course, much of the work will be in accessing the data and information from various sources and synthesizing it into one application that would be easy to use. The design of this operation will be the most important aspect. Some of the code required is already available via similar open source projects which harvest open data. ","Funding is essential to getting this project of the ground. Starting with perfecting the design of the site, the funding will help to connect with a few [confidential] programmers, and hammer out the specifics. Then the funding will be used to operate the site for one to two years afterwards, until it flies on its own, like an eagle. ","This is a movement to illuminate and cultivate data on the built environment—there are plenty of ways to monetize the idea of this site (think: real estate), but it’s probably better to think of the noble aims of improving cities and buildings. A noble funding project might be to connect buildings that are underutilized with businesses or projects aiming to use that space. "

Real world places deserve this same level of visibility and capability. ","There have been geospatial search platforms such as Google Places, SimpleGeo, and Factual but they all lacked a simple application that let common users create, annotate, manage and share places. ","Search is a tried and true technology. Lucene was introduced 11 years ago, and highly scalable search technologies such as SOLR and Elastic Search have made search scalable and stable. Geospatial capabilities have been introduced to these core search technologies, and the ability to create custom geospatial indexes. Google Maps API provides advance mapping technologies. Highly scalable NoSql databases such as Dynamo DB from Amazon make it possible to store millions, even billions of documents for retrieval quickly. By combining these technologies with a web application that simplifies the annotation and categorization of places in the geospatial store a new platform emerges.","Welocally has been developing location based tools to help indie journalists build location aware directories and grow their reputations as local referrers.

We have the components necessary to make places work with any website, most of the parts exist in the products welocally.com sells already. The next goal is to make a powerful yet simple geospatial search engine for tagging, categorizing and annotating information about real world locations. We then want to expose the search capabilities as a set of widgets and a mobile portal so people share and create location rich uses of places. ",Primarily for founder focus.

We will bring these stories out and compel authorities to intervene","In Uganda, climate change is already a reality and poor communities are the most affected. Climate change related disasters like prolonged droughts are already threatening food security in many parts of the country but unfortunately, most of these disasters go unreported or are reported too late when they have already claimed lives. We recently piloted a project in Uganda which is helping to bring these stories to light early enough to enable the government and AID workers intervene before people die.The success of this pilot has motivated us to think of turning this project into a full-time community radio.","The team includes three Ugandans: 1.  Sanga Moses, an experienced entrepreneur who is also a TED Fellow, 2012 and Unreasonable Institute, Fellow, 2011, is the Team Leader; 2.  Prosy Kawala, an experienced journalist who has worked for some of the leading media houses in Uganda in the last 5 years will lead the technical team and will be the head of programs; 3.  Peter Mulinda, an experienced accountant who worked for the local tax authority for 15 years will be the head of finance.","We conducted a successful pilot in a small village in Uganda. We started a very small village radio with simple equipment and we put in place a telephone number and encouraged villagers to call us in case there is a climate change or environment related emergency in their community. We were overwhelmed by the calls we received! Through this, we saved one of Uganda’s biggest rain forests from destruction by loggers when local people informed us that loggers come at night and we tipped off the government which deployed soldiers at night and all the loggers were arrested.","The funds will be used to buy radio equipment, buy computers, pay government licenses and put in place internet facilities and telephone facilities. We will also use part of the funds to promote the radio in our target communities and to hire and train staff.","This radio will also broadcast commercials for businesses and government programs at a fee.

It is hard to stay informed about candidates and legislation, and corporate interest isn’t easy to detect.This project will make it easy to stay politically informed and to act upon the most meaningful information. As a resource, it will shine light on the esoteric world of politics and influence.

"Hawaii Revised Statutes, Bill Tracking and Civic Involvement",http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/24954192986/hawaii-revised-statutes-bill-tracking-and-civic,,The project will create databases and APIs for Hawaii Revised Statutes to mashup with bill tracking and civic commenting.,The data isn’t in a form that is manageable. So the first step is creating APIs to collect and disseminate the data. The next step is combining the HRS data with bill proposals to show how laws are being changed and allow for civic commenting for submission to the State.,Currently there is no project of this type in Hawaii. This project looks to expand on concepts being used or developed in other states to fit into Hawaii’s environment.,"Hawaii recently hired its first CIO, Sanjeev Bhagowalia, who is pushing for innovation and open data. However, the state is having a difficult time getting launched. In Bhagowalia’s initial assessment, he’s looking at a ten-year project with the majority of resources getting up to today’s standards. This project will be another example of open data in Hawaii and drive community involvement. I coded a similar project to capture campaign spending, office of elections and ethics data into a site with data visualizations as a proof-of-concept for the agencies to see how their data can be used (https://brchawaii.com/influence).","The project lead will be myself. However, I will be using all of my resources to expand the project’s reach and use. Having worked in local media for the past ten years, I have strong ties to local news outlets as well as with state organizations through my past projects. This includes volunteering for working groups within the state’s Office of Information Management and Technology. I believe that while most of the coding will be done by me, I’ll have some assistance from the state as well as other civic organizations.","I’ve built some of the basic data collection code for the Hawaii Revised Statutes as well as a rough bill tracking system. These need to be polished and automated in order for them to work together in producing a cohesive product. If I had to put a percent completion on this piece, I’d say it’s 60% complete.","The main use of the funds would be for hosting services and to pay for my time to design, develop and implement the project.","If the project is successful, I would then request to move it into the state system and donate migration services to accomplish the move. There are also a few non-profits that have been looking for this type of development that at the very least could use the open APIs."

NGO Transparency Indicator,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/24954186983/ngo-transparency-indicator,12000,Collect data on NGOs in order to rate their transparency policy by building an indicator,"NGOs are a relevant actor in international development. However, donors and international development agencies encounter several difficulties in establishing NGOs transparency and accountability. The development of the Transparency Indicator provides donors and other stakeholders crucial information about NGOs thereby assisting them in allocating their funds in the most efficient way. ","My idea was inspired by Transparency International’s CPI Index. The CPI Index rates countries’ corruption level according to people’s perception. However, there is no similar indicator rating NGOs transparency.","The NGO Transparency Indicator will work because international development agencies struggle every day in order to allocate their funds in projects yielding the highest social impact. Donors are therefore interested in gaining information about grantees to facilitate this process. Unfortunately, not all NGOs are established for purely developmental purposes. In developing countries in particular, many people are aware of the availability of huge streams of funds international agencies disburse every year. Therefore, many NGOs are set up with the only objective of gaining access to this flow of capital without delivering any impact.",I am an independent researcher and I am the only one currently working on this project. I am currently in Accra working at an NGO that is interested in developing my idea. I am focusing on developing the Transparency Indicator based on Ghanaian NGOs.  ,"I have currently gained access to the information necessary to develop such a tool, and I have researched and selected the key criteria on which the Indicator will rate NGOs’ transparency. Data refers to hundreds of legally registered NGOs in Ghana ","I would use the funds to develop the next steps of the project, namely acquiring and processing all available data, and eventually create an online version with the assistance of an IT expert. The will therefore cover logistical and administrative cost as well as the consultancy of the IT expert.",There is a huge potential for scale-up opportunities. One way is to propose the Transparency Indicator to Research Organizations and try to further develop it by including NGOs from other countries. The NGO Transparency Indicator can eventually extend on the global scale providing information about NGOs worldwide.

Michele Obama’s “Let’s Move!” campaign works toward combating childhood obesity, but it does not offer a similar web-based application.   ","Results from The Cooper Institute’s 2011 NutriGram pilot of over 1,800 Texas students showed some promising preliminary results for students, families, and the community: students asked care-givers to buy healthier foods, teachers allowed students to access the program in summer months and during free time, teachers started a walking program, and some reported being more conscious of personal weight issues and the influence of eating behaviors on students.  Of these same children, 46% ate fast food at least twice a week and did not understand that low-fat milk was a healthier choice than whole milk.  ","The Cooper Institute and The Michael & Susan Dell Center for Healthy Living provide a valuable background for this project: a) experience with development of tools for assessing diet and physical activity in school children; b) experience in analyzing dietary and physical activity measures for children; and c) experience in the translation of research findings into reports for the general population and stakeholders. For 30 years, The Cooper Institute has successfully administered FITNESSGRAM (FG), a school-based physical fitness assessment software program in 86,000 schools with 14.3M children assessed.  The NFL Charities awarded a grant to FG to partner with the NFL PLAY 60 initiative to assess and evaluate the activity initiatives for all school-based programs at 1,120 schools, across all NFL markets.","The Cooper Institute developed both the web-based nutrition and behavior assessment tool and video game for elementary school children in 2010-11 after receiving a $1.86M grant from the Texas Department of Agriculture. In 2001, the survey assessment tool was successfully pilot tested with a group of 1,800 students from 14 elementary schools across Texas.  Governments are moving to make data more available and useful to citizens. One example is the White House’s digital government strategy. Announced last week, the strategy calls for “agencies to make as much data as possible public and machine-readable through application programming interfaces — APIs — and other tools.”  As such, we consider a web-based data-collection application to be an important step in maximizing accessibility and benefits.","The funds would enable the development of a nationwide pre/post-pilot that would aggregate, track, and analyze the nutrition knowledge and eating behaviors of elementary students.  Findings would be published and communicated to the “Let’s Move!” initiative, the CDC, the Obama administration, and other key stakeholders.",This program can be easily disseminated and implemented as part of multi-level school-based interventions to promote healthy diet and help prevent chronic childhood diseases.  Participating schools would be given the option to continue utilizing the application by paying an annual fee of $399.

She has had a long-lived passion for the arts, and has participated in five murals, two of which she organized and designed.","Nothing permanent has been built, but many networking connections have been made through projects Hannah has worked on.  Her mural efforts have created contacts with artist in Miami, FL; non-profits in Takeo Cambodia; and a sustainable development, Kalu Yala, in Panamá. Her data management experience has created contacts at the University of Florida’s Urban and Regional Planning Department, and with the GeoPlan Center.","Funds would be used towards development of interactive website, on-site visits, employee salaries, and mural materials.","By collaborating with for non-profits, local business, advocacy groups, local administrations and other funding sources to sponsor Data Murals."
DAMs - ,http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/24632381626/dams,3,With ‘CLOUD’ drive concept picking up rapidly with tech savvy people using the Data stored on Cloud Servers anywhere anytime from any Computer. This new virtual data management with good back-up system in place can do wonders to integrate digitized information with all available software development for such purposes. These ‘Cloud Servers’ will act like Angels in the Sky with connectivity & communications 24/7 Globally. But such new technical option would take some time to make it user friendly and popular among all to access & exchange information with best IT products already available in the industry to reach maximum people in their comforts & no inconvenience what so ever. Technically possible but to create the buzz among all online users and TV-Radio audience we plan a full proof strategy using common sense & psyche of human behavior in using anything when he/she needs or wishes to use it & share it with nothing to loose kind of infrastructure  for this particular purpose. (e.g -1) People use  ’watches’ to know the time.2) People use Maps to reach destinations and places of interest. 3) People use RSS feed for News & other information. Also TV channels & Radios for News updates. etc) We apply similar method to get people use to it once they like our tool/system to interact & access News & Information gathered & stored digitally in a universal format for everyone to understand .,Like any other Media or Marketing does by collecting Consumer/User/ Audience likes & dislikes by asking them to fill a form or just give Yes or No or Maybe options to find our answers. We will categorize he/she profiles to make our job easier with shorter & precise proforma technically to channelize information reach only those who want it in their own way & as per the need. Like choosing format of news output or region from where one wishes to get knowledge. ,Our Data servers will work like ‘Water Dams’  where all sources of water is collected and then distributed for various  needs. While in principle it is build to generate electricity power at the same time serve as Water Tank to supply water for various human needs withut much efforts once we build the Dam ( Cloud Servers). ,What is proposed here is nothing new technically & 1000s of techies are using it in small & big businesses all over the world as per the need. Internet usage is common like using mobile phones & GPS gadgets. Once IT structure is organized with good digital planning & distribution  classifying Users then system will work automatically.,"",Planing CMS & distribution of Content. Also identifying ends users & their classification process.,A proper Business Plan will be submitted as per the need giving phase wise expenditure plan to fulfill this project with 3 years plan. After you shortlist us with our basic ideas said so far in your questionnaire we will be happy to share tell more in detail. We will hire services of reputed IT company to provide us technical support & tie up with major news sources to create (sample) content categories & user profiles to target specific  information served or exchanged between 2 individuals/entities digitally.,Our Business plan will have revenue model and revenue projections after the completion of project in 3 yrs. LIke Reuters every news business entity will subscribe to our ‘DAMs’ as per the regional and global informations one wishes to buy by subscribing to it with good rental options by taking minimal charges to such long term set up.

As a photographer for over 45 years, before digital, one of the most difficult aspects was how to make decisions based on comparisons of the best image or choice often having to us a glass to view a 35mm negative on a lightbox. This system brings the facility of digital to all analog photographic sources.","I, Mark Heliger.  \","I have a wonderfully operational system. It includes Master files, a catalog and a FileMaker and Bento database interface to make action requests., but it needs refinement to work on a larger scale and funding would allow me to assemble the package to make available to libraries, government agencies such as national parks, colleges, universities and other facilities with a lot of images that need cataloging.","I would establish an equipment baseline, refine the documentation on how to operate it, contact libraries, museums, and other organizations to match the system to their cataloging requirements. I would then make the system available and offer training to whomever sees the advantage of rapidly digitizing and offering access to the wealth of analog data we have in the world. I would create an operational model using the Yosemite Museum in Yosemite National Park to digitize and catalog their historic collection, including stereoscopic slides for access by the general public via devices such as the iPad.","I would set up a company that offers the system and as technology advances, refines the details of procedures, offers system training and connects agencies. I would also build bridges of access through particular publishing projects that have historical significance. I just recently completed my first, for the iPad. Alcatraz – Journey to the Island.

Majority of the people are still unknown about the wonders the cyberspace can do other than Internet and email. Internet has become a necessity and people would definitely be interested to be able to access an open source data and at the same time be able to enhance their career.

Similarly a certain amount of proceeds from the project revenue will go in funding ICT programs and expanding the program to rural areas. ",Right now I am working on it. Albeit there is nothing to showcase at the moment but I have been constantly working on plotting the design. I also plan to be associated with like-minded individuals and entrepreneurs to enhance the success rate even higher. ,So far the modality part of the project has already been plotted. It includes the method of obtaining data and providing open access to the public. ,I use the News Challenge funds to expand the usage of Internet strongly integrating data with knowledge and opportunities. It would be used mainly to maintain the platform and get it going. ,"The initial phase will be the promotion phase where money generation wouldn’t be the target but sustainability would be looked upon as to create a brand and impact of the platform in the society.

But there is nothing that combines the two. ","Because it appeals to a near ubiquitous feeling for anyone who spends time on the Internet – a feeling of being overwhelmed. From “experienced” news consumers, to folks who don’t do much reading at all, there’s a sense that important stories are falling through the cracks, or simply that there’s too much out there and it’d be impossible to even start. In a nutshell, keeping up feels difficult. The name of this app, then, is purposeful. By walking users through simple steps, EasyNewsIt will take the stress out of information and truly help people be better news consumers. ","At this time, just me. I have developer and designer interest from a few folks, as well as from a large app company, though I’d decline to give names just yet.","The basic user flow (wireframes). There’s more, but here’s the core process: define news priorities (e.g. local, international, industry), rate each priority’s importance on a 1-10 scale, and define how much time you plan to allocate to reading each day or week. EasyNewsIt then creates a suggested news “diet.” As users interact with it, the app tracks their behavior. At end of week (or any time), users can see whether they fulfilled their goals and modify up or down based on how they’re doing. ","To design, build and get the word out about EasyNewsIt. More specifically, I’d hire a designer, developer, possibly a product/UX consultant, and a social/online marketing person. ","Like RSS readers, EasyNewsIt requires very little maintenance. Also like RSS readers, upgrades could be covered through donations. Also a possibility: paid mobile app. If project sees wide adoption, we may develop future iterations, like a podcast habit builder and competitive game. In this case, corporate funding may be possible. "

Also it targets a large user base of non-programming, generic-wiki users for multiple languages.",The project addresses many reasons the overload of data is not utilized to its potential. It makes using data easy for non-programming people. It provides a user contributed library of source data and user help. The wiki aspect adds the power of wikis to enable data analysis by many people. By being wiki generic it increases the potential number of wikis using the software. These wikis will focus on their specific areas of interest.

Realizing the benefits of involving others, I have budgeted time and money in the project to bring in additional help.",On my website I have integrated some of the tools into a popular open source wiki. These tools allow users to display tables and charts of data from either a hosted MySQL database or remote csv files. I have added an interface to generate MySQL queries that requires no knowledge of the database structure or MySQL syntax. There is a user contributed library of remote csv file links.

This will improve collection of data in areas out of reach and reduce assumptions made with respect to statistics from such areas.,Most mobile based data collection utilizes the use of mobile applications however this applications ride on smartphones which are limited in Africa hence our utilization of simple phones,Anyone seeking to send data will send the data in form of an sms to a particular number in a predefined format for data collection eg 10#20#30#40. Once the message is sent it will be received automatically via a GSM modem attached to a computer or laptop with the kusanya application active in it at the data collection center. This message will be displayed real-time as data and stored in a database in the same computer. From the Kusanya interface reports will be available at the click of a button.,This solution is developed by BTI Millaman Limited a young software development company located in Nairobi whose directors are Dunstan Machoka (Bsc.

Private sector leverages information to aid decision making but there are currently no tools to deliver this level of intelligence to county leaders. Countellect will deliver the business intelligence that will guide policy and decision making.",There is currently no live platform in Kenya that marries both entire sets of census and available open data targeted for use by elected government officials and civil servants.,Discerning leaders running for elective posts are aware of the great responsibilities that a devolved government brings and the scrutiny by the public on their performance. 100% of these leaders will have something to prove and understand that they will be measured by how they meet their constituents needs. The data that would deliver this much needed “business intelligence” exists but not in a form that makes sense or is easily accessible. The shared cost of ownership on Countellect will reduce both risk and cost of adoption while delivering value that none would get with an independent initiative.,"Countellect is the brainchild of Mbugua Njihia and Linet Kwamboka. Mbugua – CEO of Symbiotic is techpreneur with over 8 years experience in web and mobile services, possessing  unique insight that marries technology with the market place and has consulted for the government of Kenya with special focus on m-government. Linet leads the Kenya Open Data Initiative and the Open Government Partnership at the Kenya ICT Board. She has consulted for multiple companies both locally and internationally including the World Bank, the One Acre Fund, Innovations for Poverty Action, the TIST program, Upande ltd, Maker Faire Africa among others.",We have completed the platform schematic and mapped out the data needs that will be crucial for the initial platform rollout. Analysis of available datasets is currently underway to ascertain how much more if at all will be required for the realization of the county intelligence dashboard.,"Funds will be used to engage additional human resource to fastrack platform development. This will be on the information architecture, users experience design, user interface design, backend programming, data aggregation and project administration front. Infrastructure, target user awareness and “trial period” costs will also be met by the fund.",Countellect will be offered on an annual subscription model with an initial 3 month trial. It is a not for profit initiative and the revenue generated will server to maintain the team that will continually ensure all possible datasets are fed into the platform and meet other administration costs.

The problem, as articulated above, is that they can’t train enough people, fast enough, to become data scientists.   MetaLayer solves this problem by giving business users, journalists and researchers tools that they don’t need to be experts in to use.

There are also district-level, block-level and school-level differences. A standard policy across schools to improve learning outcomes can not work, as it does not allow customization. Customization requires high-quality data. However, this is not enough. Stakeholders such as local policy-makers need to have the capacity to work with such data – such as technology to collate data, data assessment skills and so on. Also, stakeholders such as parents need to be aware of the data and its implications.

Data literacy – The students learn how to read the data and to disseminate this data to various stakeholders in forms they can understand. Accountability – Here they learn how to use the data analysis to develop solutions for various challenges that a school is facing. ","The course modules for this project have already been built and 8 modules of this course have already been administered to 9 students over the course of 2 years.  Two data-analysis reports have been taken out during this time - The PAISA National Report, and the District-Report-Card, both of which are available on our websites.  We are now in the “Accountability” phase of our course, where we are teaching the students how to develop solutions based on the data they have uncovered. ","The News Challenge funds would be used to modify the current course modules, develop appropriate course material and pilot it with more people.

We want to create an easy to use web site and publish and distribute tabloids that display TIF information graphically. We want to start with one ward in Chicago and one suburban township in Cook County. We want to convene local town meetings to explain TIFs and local government finance and train interested citizens to monitor these projects via a shared-work web site. The results of our own work and the collected work of our citizen-journalists will be collected and summarized regularly and distributed to the local press and good government watchdog organizations.","There is no organization in Chicago, Illinois or anywhere that I know of that is dedicated to exposing TIFs and planning on training citizen journalists to help unearth the facts and explore the local impacts of TIFs. In Chicago there are some 160 TIF districts across the city that, in 2011, diverted some $510 million in property taxes from units of government that rely on them for operation. Countywide, the number was a staggering $832 million. In July we’ll know the comparable numbers for 2011. TIFs are widely abused here and there is regular reporting (if you know where to look) that documents the private interests who receive these funds with virtually no public discussion, review or recourse.","TIFs are a HOT topic in Chicago and a number of large players are agitated and working around this issue - including the Chicago Teachers Union, The RAISE Your Hand Coalition of public school parents, and the Sweet Home Chicago Coalition advocating for affordable housing. Progressive and conservative watchdog groups have editorialized against the many abuses and lack of transparency in the TIF program here. But there is no one place and platform for ongoing research, education and dissemination about this important financial program - one that has been variously called “the mayor’s private slush fund,” “financial spackle for city projects that go over budget” and a “boondoogle” for connected private developers.

We see that there are a wide array of customers for a subscription service as well as an annual graphic gazette update on TIF activity in the county. These potential customers include all school districts, local library boards, park district officials, real estate developers, good government groups, tax activist groups and even local elected officials who want to know what the impact of proposed or existing TIFs have on their districts. In addition, we see raising funds from contributions from affected citizens and fees from speaking and training activities."
